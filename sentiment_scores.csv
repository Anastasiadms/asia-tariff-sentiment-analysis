Follow: 
Japan’s Emperor Emeritus Akihito will be admitted to hospital for heart tests on Tuesday, public broadcaster NHK reported, citing the Imperial Household Agency.
     
Akihito, 91, who is retired, is the father of Emperor Naruhito. He abdicated from the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019, seven years after he had heart bypass surgery.
     
            The former emperor will undergo tests at the University of Tokyo Hospital after signs of myocardial ischemia were found during a regular checkup last month, NHK reported, citing the Imperial Household Agency. The condition reduces blood flow to the heart muscle.
     
            Akihito, who ascended to the throne after his father, Hirohito, died in 1989, became the first Japanese monarch in 200 years to abdicate his post.
 
            He cited health reasons for standing down, having undergone heart surgery and been treated for prostate cancer in the years preceding his abdication.
     
            A man prepared to break with tradition, Akihito was the first Japanese emperor to marry a commoner, speak to his subjects live on television, and be hands-on in raising his children.
     
            The emperor is a ceremonial but revered figure in Japan’s constitutional monarchy. It is the oldest hereditary monarchy in the world, dating back 14 centuries.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl,"Pahalgam, India: At least 26 people killed as gunmen open fire on tourists in Jammu and Kashmir | CNN
Follow: 
            Gunmen killed at least 26 people and injured a dozen others in the disputed Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, a rare assault on tourists in an area fraught by decades of insurgency and opposition to India’s rule.
     
            The devastating massacre targeted sightseers in a popular tourist destination in Pahalgam, in the mountainous Anantnag district, and is the region’s worst assault on civilians in years. Most of the 26 people killed are understood to be travelers.
     
            While authorities investigate the attack, tensions are rising between India and its neighbor. Despite Pakistan denying that it had any role in the attack, India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a Wednesday press conference that “cross-border linkages of the terrorist act” had been “brought out” during a special meeting of his country’s security cabinet.
     
            Among the victims was a Nepali national, and another person of “Indian origin who works in the Middle East,” V K Birdi, inspector general of police in Kashmir, told CNN. Misri added that in addition to the Nepali citizen killed, the other 25 victims of the attack were Indian.
     
            Birdi told CNN that the attack took place in a part of the Baisaran Valley – which is only accessible by foot or on horseback. The assault unfolded in a meadow, with mountainous ridges nearby, that stretched several miles without any car roads, he said.
     
            Survivors described horror as the attack unfolded and a bloody scene wrought by the gunmen.
     
            One eyewitness told the news agency Press Trust of India that unidentified gunmen opened fire on the tourists from close range.
     
            “My husband was shot in the head while seven others were also injured in the attack,” one woman survivor said, according to PTI.
     
            Another survivor, Asavari Jagdale, told PTI the gunmen came into the tent where her family was hiding. The attackers accused the family – hailing from India’s western Pune city – of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before shooting Jagdale’s male relatives, including her father, she said.
     
            Local resident Abdul Waheed told CNN he jumped on his pony to help transport the injured back to areas where they could be driven to the hospital, and enlisted others in his local pony association to help. For those who were too injured, they used makeshift cots to carry them down the valley.
     
            “I saw people crying, screaming, just lying in the aftermath of the attack. There were children, women, men, everyone,” he said. “It was a massive trauma. I did not sleep all night.”
     
            A little-known militant group called The Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the attack on social media, voicing discontent at “outsiders” who had settled in the region and caused a “demographic change.” It did not provide evidence, and CNN cannot independently verify its claim.
     
            Birdi told CNN authorities were aware the group had claimed responsibility, but said they were still investigating the matter. As of Wednesday, authorities had carried out medical examinations on the victims, and flown the bodies of the deceased to their home states. Some funerals were held, including that of an Indian Navy Lieutenant who was visiting the destination with his wife.
     
            On Wednesday evening, police in Kashmir announced a reward of 2 million Indian rupees ($23,433) for “any information leading to the neutralization of the terrorists involved in this cowardly act.”
     
            The picturesque Himalayan region, administered in part by both India and Pakistan though still disputed by both sides, is often rife with violence and has a heavy security presence – but attacks on tourists are rare.
     
            “It is an implicit sort of contract between the local population and the militant groups that the tourist trade will not be undermined because almost everyone in Kashmir, especially in the Valley, is directly or indirectly dependent on the tourism industry,” said counter-terrorism expert and author Ajai Sahni.
     
            By Tuesday night, outraged residents had gathered in the region to protest. Videos of the protest show a crowd chanting slogans, holding candles and signs that read: “Stop terrorism.” Other signs called for the resignation of Indian home affairs minister, Amit Shah. Tourists were also scrambling to leave the region, with airlines putting on extra flights.
     
            “Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice… they will not be spared! Their evil agenda will never succeed,” Indian leader Modi wrote on X.
     
            Following the attack, Modi cut short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
     
            India’s defense minister Rajnath Singh called the attack “religiously targeted” and “cowardly” on Wednesday, adding that the Indian government will take “appropriate action.”
     
            The Indian Army corps responsible for military operations in the area of the attack said a search operation was underway to bring “the attackers to justice.” Shah, the home minister, arrived in the region on Tuesday and chaired a high-level security meeting, his office said.
     
            India has long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups that target Kashmir, something Islamabad denies. Attacks by militants have in the past led to a sharp escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, both of whom have rival claims to the Himalayan region. India conducted air strikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following an insurgent attack on Indian soldiers.
     
            A spokesperson from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs extended condolences to the victims, adding: “We are concerned at the loss of tourists’ lives in an attack in Anantnag district of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
     
            The attack came a day after US Vice President JD Vance arrived in India for a visit with his family. On Tuesday, he shared condolences on X, writing: “Over the past few days, we have been overcome with the beauty of this country and its people. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they mourn this horrific attack.”
     
            US President Donald Trump also condemned the attack, expressing US solidarity with India against terrorism and calling Modi to convey his condolences, according to Indian authorities.
     
            Other leaders from Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran, France, Italy and the UAE also expressed condemnation.
     
            Claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, the mountainous Kashmir region has been at the epicenter of an often-violent territorial struggle between the countries for more than 70 years. The region is one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints, and a de facto border called the Line of Control divides the areas overseen by New Delhi and Islamabad.
     
            Throughout the past two decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, with tens of thousands of people killed in the violence.
     
            Violence surged in 2018, and the Indian government took greater control of the region in 2019 amid a heavy military presence and a monthslong communications blackout.
     
            While the Indian government has said that militancy has since been reduced, attacks continue to plague the region.
     
            On Tuesday, a regional spokesperson from Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused Pakistan of fueling terrorism in the region, and called the attack an “outcome of Pakistan’s frustration.”
     
            “Pakistan and its proxies are unable to digest the return of peace and tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. They want to stifle growth and plunge the region back into fear. But we won’t allow that to happen,” Altaf Thakur said.
     
            Pakistan’s defense minister Khawaja Asif denied any link to the attack.
     
            “We have nothing to do with this, and we do not support terrorism anywhere,” he said in a TV interview with a Pakistani news outlet.
     
            Pakistan has denied that it had any role in the attack, but India’s foreign secretary announced a number of measures against Islamabad at Wednesday night’s briefing, after Modi chaired a high-level security briefing where “cross border linkages of the terrorist act were brought out,” Misri said.
     
            A significant water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan will be suspended with immediate effect until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably” renounces “its support for cross-border terrorism,” the foreign secretary announced.
     
            Pakistani nationals in India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme, a scheme that allows professionals, including dignitaries, judges, parliamentarians, and journalists to enter member states visa-free, must now leave the country within 48 hours, he continued.
     
            In addition, military, naval and air advisors from the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi must now leave India within the next week, having been declared persona non grata, Misri added. India will also withdraw its military advisors from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad and a key trading check-post between the two nations will be closed, he said.
     
            After Misri’s announcement, Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that his country’s National Security Committee will meet on Thursday to respond to the measures.
     
            Pakistan’s Minister of Energy, Awais Leghari, said in a statement that “India’s reckless suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is an act of water warfare; a cowardly, illegal move. Every drop is ours by right, and we will defend it with full force — legally, politically, and globally.”
     
            Local Kashmiris are fearful of a growing anti-Kashmiri and anti-Muslim sentiment brewing on social media and in statements made on national news channels.
     
            “All of Kashmir is in grief and shock, terror has no religion, these haunting images will remain etched in our collective memory, but we are being defamed,” Nasir Khuehami of the Jammu and Kashmir Students Association told CNN Wednesday from Srinagar, the largest city in Jammu and Kashmir.
     
            “Kashmiris have always faced violence and we know what it is like to lose a father or son, we empathize with these families,” he said, adding he has been receiving messages from Kashmiri students across the country who are afraid of being attacked.
     
            Sahni, the counter-terrorism expert, said the attack would likely fuel both sides – celebrated as a triumph by Islamist extremists, and feeding fear and Islamophobia among India’s majority Hindu population, thus deepening already-fraught tensions between the two faiths.
     
            “Since this has been an attack specifically on Hindu tourists, so once again it will feed into the communal narrative on both sides,” she added.
     
            Pahalgam lies on a major pilgrimage route, known as the Amarnath Yatra, which takes place every year and has been exposed to previous attacks.
     
            Thousands of tourists flock to Kashmir during its peak season each year, which runs from March to August.
     
            The last major attack on tourists in the region took place in June. At least nine people were killed and 33 others injured when a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims plunged into a gorge, after suspected militants fired on the vehicle.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/02/asia/singapore-election-ruling-party-test-intl-hnk,"Singapore votes in test of ruling party’s monopoly | CNN
Follow: 
            Singapore is holding an election on Saturday almost certain to perpetuate the unbroken rule of the People’s Action Party, in a test of public approval for its new prime minister as the city-state braces for economic turbulence from a global trade war.
     
            The election is a bellwether for the popularity of the PAP, which has ruled since before Singapore’s 1965 independence, with attention on whether the opposition can challenge the ruling party’s tight grip on power and make further inroads after small but unprecedented gains in the last contest.
     
            Though the PAP has consistently won in landslides with about 90% of seats, its share of the popular vote is closely watched as a measure of the strength of its mandate, with premier Lawrence Wong keen to improve on the PAP’s 60.1% in the 2020 election - one of its worst performances on record.
     
            Wong, 52, became the Asian financial hub’s fourth prime minister last year, promising continuity, new blood and to lead Singapore his own way.
     
            He took over at the end of the two-decade premiership of Lee Hsien Loong, the son of former leader Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore.
     
            Polls opened at 8 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m. (8 a.m. ET), with a result expected in the early hours of Sunday.
     
            Living costs and housing availability in one of the world’s most expensive cities are key issues for the 2.76 million voters and a continued challenge for Wong, whose government has warned of recession if the trade-dependent economy becomes collateral damage in the war over steep U.S. tariffs.
     
            The PAP has long had the upper hand in politics, with a big membership to draw from, influence in state institutions and far greater resources than its untested opponents, which are each running in only a small number of constituencies.
     
            The election will be a lopsided affair, with 46% of all candidates representing the PAP, which is contesting all 97 seats compared to 26 for its biggest rival, the Workers’ Party, which won 10 last time, the most by an opposition party.
     
            But though a PAP defeat is extremely unlikely, some analysts say the election could alter the dynamic of Singapore politics in the years ahead if the opposition can make more headway, with younger voters keen to see alternative voices, greater scrutiny and more robust debate.
     
            “It is to be expected that (its) overall electoral support will gradually, gradually dip from general election to general election,” said National University of Singapore political scientist Lam Peng Er.
     
            “Would Singaporeans be that surprised if the PAP’s electoral support were to dip to 57% or 58%? It will surprise nobody. I don’t think it will even surprise the PAP at all.”
     
            The PAP for its part is keen to avoid upsets and warned voters of the consequences of seat losses for key cabinet members, whom Wong said were critical to balancing ties between the United States and China and navigating Singapore’s highly exposed economy through potentially choppy waters.
     
            “I have backups … sure. But everyone knows that the team cannot function at the same level,” Wong told the 1.4 million-strong labor union on Thursday.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/28/india/india-us-fentanyl-report-intl-hnk,"India among top suppliers of illicit fentanyl precursors, US intelligence report says | CNN
Follow: 
            India has emerged as a growing player in the illicit fentanyl trade, a new US intelligence report says, a designation likely to raise alarm in New Delhi as President Donald Trump wields tariffs on countries he accuses of not doing enough to stop the deadly drug from flowing into the United States.
     
            Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that can be 100 times more potent than morphine, is the most common drug involved in overdose deaths in the US – fueling an opioid crisis that has become a high-priority issue for the Trump administration.
     
            For many years, China has been the largest source of both legal supplies of the drug – which is prescribed for severe pain relief – and illicit supplies of precursor chemicals that are typically processed in labs in Mexico before the final product is smuggled across the US border.
     
            But India’s role in the illegal trade is becoming more prominent, according to the 2025 Annual Threat Assessment (ATA) report published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence this month.
     
            “Nonstate groups are often enabled, both directly and indirectly, by state actors, such as China and India as sources of precursors and equipment for drug traffickers,” the report said.
     
            “China remains the primary source country for illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment, followed by India.”
     
Last year’s ATA report named India as among countries other than China where Mexican cartels were sourcing precursor chemicals to a “lesser extent.” The 2023 report made no mention of India in relation to fentanyl.
     
            India is a global leader in generic drug manufacturing, supplying a significant portion of the world’s vaccines and medicines. It has a pharmaceutical industry so large, it is often referred to as the “Pharmacy of the World.” But the industry has been marred by controversy, raising concerns about regulation and quality control.
     
            On March 17, India’s Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) in the western state of Gujarat said it had arrested two people linked to Surat-based pharmaceutical companies for allegedly exporting illicit fentanyl precursors to Mexico and Guatemala, according to the Press Trust of India. CNN has reached out to the ATS.
     
            Days later, the US Department of Justice indicted three top executives from a Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company for allegedly importing ingredients used to make illicit fentanyl.
     
            New Delhi has not publicly spoken about the ATA report. CNN has contacted India’s Ministry of External Affairs for a response.
     
            The report comes at a delicate time for India as it mounts a case to avoid US tariffs.
     
            The US was India’s largest trading partner in 2024, accounting for almost $120 billion in trade, yet India only ranked tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year.
     
            Indian economist and researcher Soumya Bhowmik said the ATA report “may introduce complexities in India-US relations,” and could “open the door for tougher rhetoric and potentially even targeted tariffs.”
     
            Earlier this month, the Trump administration enacted tariffs against the US’ top three trading partners: China, Mexico and Canada, saying the levies of up to 25% were necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl into the US.
     
            Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington in February, where he spoke with Trump about a range of issues from defense and technology to trade and economic growth.
     
            The two leaders “resolved to expand trade and investment to make their citizens more prosperous, nations stronger, economies more innovative and supply chains more resilient,” a joint statement from that meeting said.
     
            A Washington delegation is currently in New Delhi for trade talks.
     
            India has “proactively undertaken measures to respond to potential trade tensions and mitigate the impact of impending US tariffs,” said Bhowmik, including a proposal to remove import duties on goods essential for manufacturing.
     
            The ATA report also “highlights the critical importance of collaborative efforts between (the US and India) to address the global opioid crisis,” Bhowmik said.

Follow: 
            Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has for the first time acknowledged that North Korean soldiers took part in the fighting to recover Russian territory after Ukraine’s incursion into the Kursk region last year.
     
            Two days after Moscow claimed to have recaptured all of Kursk, Putin said in a Monday statement: “Our Korean friends acted out of a sense of solidarity, justice and genuine comradeship.”
     
            “We pay tribute to the heroism, high level of special training and self-sacrifice of the Korean soldiers who, shoulder to shoulder with Russian fighters, defended our homeland as their own,” he said.
     
            Meanwhile, Russian, Ukrainian, the US and European governments continue to debate the terms for any ceasefire and more permanent deal to end the fighting.
     
            On Sunday, however, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius criticized the US proposals as “a capitulation.”
     
            Ukraine knew it might have to sacrifice some territory to reach a lasting ceasefire deal “but they will certainly not go as far – or should not go as far – as the latest proposal by the American president,” Pistorius told German public broadcaster ARD on Sunday.
     
            “Ukraine on its own could have got a year ago already what was included in that (Trump proposal), practically through a capitulation,” he said. “I cannot discern any added value.”
     
            Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports have previously assessed that about 12,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to fight in Russia.
     
            In March, the South Korean military said a further 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been dispatched, as well as a “significant amount” of short-range ballistic missiles and hundreds of pieces of 170-millimeter self-propelled howitzers and 240-millimeter multiple rocket launchers.

            North Korea had not publicly confirmed its contribution until Monday, when it said: “The operations for liberating the Kursk area to repel the adventurous invasion of the Russian Federation by the Ukrainian authorities were victoriously concluded,” according to state-run news agency KCNA.
     
            Putin and Kim signed a landmark defense pact in Pyongyang last year, as the two autocratic nations ramped up ties to a “new level,” and pledged to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
     
            Russia said at the weekend that its forces had recaptured Kursk, the border region where Ukraine launched a surprise offensive last year, though Kyiv insists its troops are fiercely battling to preserve their foothold in the territory.
     
            The Ukrainian military poured precious resources into holding onto its territory there, with the view of using it as a key bargaining chip in any peace talks. The operation was also launched to relieve pressure from the embattled eastern front line.
     
            The US plan to bring a permanent end to the fighting includes Washington’s recognition of Russia’s control over Crimea – the southern Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow illegally annexed more than a decade ago – and would grant Russia additional Ukrainian territory occupied since its full-scale invasion began in 2022, according to officials familiar with the plan.
     
            Trump has been frustrated that his efforts to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv after three years of war have so far fallen short, and the White House has since mounted an increasingly urgent push to strike a deal.
     
            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that the coming week would be “very critical” in determining whether the US can continue trying to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, suggesting President Donald Trump’s deadline for reaching a deal was swiftly approaching.

            “We’re close, but we’re not close enough,” Rubio said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He added that Moscow and Kyiv were closer than ever to striking an agreement, but still tempered expectations for a breakthrough.
     
            Rubio later spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about “consolidating” preconditions for negotiations, according to the foreign ministry in Moscow, which  described the call as a “productive exchange of views.”
     
            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russia is ready to enter peace talks with Ukraine without preconditions.
     
            Peskov told Russian reporters that what the Kremlin calls the “special military operation is continuing, and the United States is continuing its efforts to bring the process to a peaceful course.”
     
            He said Putin “has repeatedly confirmed that the Russian side is ready to start the negotiation process with Ukraine without any preconditions.”
     
            Peskov said there needed to be signals from Ukraine in order for direct negotiations to resume. “At least Kyiv should take some action in this regard. They have a legal ban on doing so. But so far we have not seen such actions.”
     
            The last direct negotiations on ending the conflict were in the spring of 2022.
     
            Putin said on April 21 he was open to the possibility of bilateral talks with Ukraine, as pressure from the US builds on both sides to agree to a quick peace deal.

            Peskov said there were no immediate plans for a conversation between Putin and US President Donald Trump.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday conceded that Ukraine lacks the military might needed to retake Crimea by force but has long made it clear that making territorial concessions is a red line. Recognizing Crimea as Russian would also be illegal under Ukraine’s constitution.
     
            Following Trump and Zelensky’s remarkable face-to-face meeting at the Vatican before Pope Francis’ funeral on Saturday, the US president said they briefly discussed the issue of Crimea and that he believes Zelensky “wants to make a deal.”
     
            Trump also criticized Putin in some of his strongest comments against the Russian leader to date.
     
            “I want him to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal,” Trump said Sunday as he returned to Washington to begin what aides say will be a critical week in determining the future of US-led efforts to broker an end to the war. “We have the confines of a deal, I believe, and I want him to sign it and be done with it and just go back to life.”

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/01/style/do-ho-suh-south-korea-housing-tate,"South Korea’s unique housing culture has inspired a major new exhibition | CNN

            There is something peculiar about entering a building only to be greeted by another one inside it, so it takes a moment to adjust upon arriving on the second floor of London’s prestigious Tate Modern art gallery. Directly in front of the entryway is a 1:1 scale facsimile of Do Ho Suh’s childhood home in Seoul, which he wrapped in mulberry paper and carefully traced in graphite to produce an intricate rubbing of the exterior. It is just one of many versions of home envisioned by the Korean artist over the past 30 years.
     
            Running at Tate Modern through to October, “Walk the House” is Suh’s largest solo institutional show to date in the UK, where he has been based since 2016. Before that, he lived in the US, having studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and Yale University in the 1990s.
     
            The exhibition’s name stems from an expression used in the context of the “hanok,” a traditional Korean house that can be taken down and reassembled elsewhere, thanks to its construction and lightweight materials. The buildings have become rarer over time, because of urbanization, war and occupation, which led to the destruction of many traditional homes in the country.
     
            Suh’s own childhood home was an outlier amid Seoul’s changing cityscape during the 1970s, which underwent rapid development after  the Korean War left the city in ruins. It spurred the artist’s ongoing preoccupations with home as both a physical space that could be dissolved and reanimated, but also a psychological construct that can reflect memory and identity.
     
            Among the show’s exhibits are embroidered artworks, architectural models in various materials and scales, and film works involving complex 3D techniques. The detailed outlines picked up in Suh’s hanok rubbing are echoed in two closely related large-scale pieces on display for the first time, both of which visitors can walk inside. “Perfect Home: London, Horsham, New York, Berlin, Providence, Seoul” (2024) takes various 3D fixtures and fittings from homes Suh has lived in around the world and maps them onto a tent-like model of his London apartment. “Nest/s” (2024) is a pastel-hued tunnel, again based on different places he has called home, this time splicing together incongruous hallways — an environment that holds symbolic meaning for the artist.

            “I think that the experience of cultural displacement helped me to see these in-between spaces, the space that connects places. That journey lets me focus on transitional spaces, like corridors, staircases, entrances,” Suh told CNN at the show’s opening. The exhibition also features “Staircase” (2016), a 3D structure that was subsequently collapsed into a red, sinewy 2D tangle. “I think in general we tend to focus on destinations, but these bridges that connect those destinations, often we neglect them, but actually we spend most of our time in this transitional stage,” Suh said.
     
            There’s a translucent quality to much of the work on display. Fine, gauzy textiles are used directly within many of the pieces, as well as in the form of a subtle room divider — the closest thing to an internal wall in the main space.
     
            “For the first time since 2016, the galleries of the exhibition will have all their walls taken down in order to accommodate the multiple large-scale works that will be materialized within them, as well as the multiple times and spaces that those works carry,” said Dina Akhmadeeva, assistant curator for international art at Tate Modern, who co-curated the show with Nabila Abdel Nabi, senior curator of international art at the Hyundai Tate Research Centre: Transnational. “In doing so, the open layout will form not a linear passage or narrative, but instead encourage visitors to meander, return, loop back, evoking an experience closer to the function of memory itself.”
     
            Suh’s emphasis on spatial interventions poses creative challenges for curators as well as the institutions that hold these works. One such example is “Staircase-III” (2010), acquired by the Tate back in 2011, which often needs to be adapted to wherever it is shown by measuring new panels to fit each space. “I wanted to disturb the habitual experience of (encountering) an artwork in a museum,” said Suh by way of explanation. Akhmadeeva added that the approach challenged the “idea of permanence — of the work and of the space around it.”
     
            Removing the gallery walls also reflects Suh’s interest in peeling environments back to their foundations. “It’s just the bare space that the architects originally conceived,” he said. Suh’s work often focuses on spatial experiences rather than material goods because, just like the rooms and buildings we inhabit, an empty space behaves like a “vessel” for memories, he explained. “Over the years and the time that you’ve spent in the space, you project your own experience and energy onto it, and then it becomes a memory.”
     
            The artist does occasionally focus on ornaments and furnishings, however, as seen in his monumental film, “Robin Hood Gardens” (named after the East London housing estate it captures), which used photogrammetry to stitch together drone footage taken inside the council building awaiting demolition. It marked a rare instance of Suh documenting both residents and their belongings.

            The film illustrates the subtle politics of Suh’s practice. “Often in my case, the color and the craftsmanship and the beauty in my work distract from the political undertone of it,” he said. Issues such as privacy, security, and access to space are intimately connected to class and public policy, but his commentary is covered in a soft veil of fabric or the gentle rub of graphite. The latter is also used in “Rubbing/Loving: Company Housing of Gwangju Theater” (2012), which reflects on the deadly Gwangju Uprising of 1980. The artwork resembles the shell of a room that is unravelled to form a flat, vertical structure, like a deconstructed box. It is based on a rubbing that was taken by Suh and his assistants while blindfolded — a nod to the censorship of the military’s violent response  and its absence from South Korean collective memory.
     
            The exhibition is bookended by pieces that address sociopolitical questions. “Bridge Project” (1999) explores land ownership among other issues, while “Public Figures” (2025), an evolution of a piece Suh made for the Venice Biennale in 2001, is a subverted monument featuring an empty plinth, directing focus to the many miniature figurines upholding it. For Suh, it was intended to address Korea’s histories of both oppression and resilience. While these two exhibits may feel distinct, for Suh, all of his work interrogates the boundaries between personal and public space, and the conditions that force transience or enable permanence.
     
            The tension between public and private was thrown into sharp relief during the pandemic, when lockdowns forced people to spend most of their time indoors. Although Suh “scrutinized” all corners of his home during this time, the lockdowns didn’t materialize in his practice in the way one might expect. Instead, it elicited a more tender reflection on what is often the making of a home: people. It explains why, among the substantial, often colorful structures in the exhibition, there are two small tunics made for (and with) his two young daughters, adorned with pockets holding their most cherished belongings, such as crayons and toys.
     
            “As a parent, it was quite a vulnerable situation. Other families, I cannot speak for them, but it really helped us to be together,” said Suh.

Follow: 
            Singapore’s People’s Action Party won its 14th successive election on Saturday to extend its unbroken six-decade rule, delivering a strong mandate to its new premier as the city-state braces for economic turbulence from a global trade war.
     
            The PAP, which has ruled since before Singapore’s 1965 independence, won 87 of the 97 parliamentary seats up for grabs, with victories by huge margins in many of the 33 constituencies as the opposition failed to extend gains in previous contests.
     
            The election was a bellwether of the popularity of the PAP amid some signs of disenchantment with its tight grip on power in the Asian financial hub, whose six million people have known no other kind of government.
     
            Though the PAP has consistently won about 90% of seats, its share of the popular vote is closely watched as a measure of the strength of its mandate, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong eager to leave a mark on his first election in charge after one of the PAP’s worst performances on record last time.
     
            The PAP had yet to be formally declared winner but took 65.57% of the vote, according to local media, surpassing the 61.2% achieved in the 2020 contest.
     
            The outcome will be seen as a ringing public endorsement of US-educated Wong, 52, who became Singapore’s fourth prime minister last year, promising continuity as well as new blood and a new style of leadership.
     
            He took over at the end of the two-decade premiership of Lee Hsien Loong, the son of former leader Lee Kuan Yew, founder of modern Singapore.
     
            Wong must address high living costs and a shortage of housing: persistent problems in one of the world’s most expensive cities, which faces a risk of recession and job losses if its trade-dependent economy takes a hit from the trade war triggered by steep US tariffs.
     
            Wong thanked his constituents, saying: “We are grateful once again for your strong mandate, and we will honor it.”
     
            Though the PAP win maintains the status quo, the margin of victory in most races was significant, with the opposition decimated and PAP candidates winning more than two-thirds of the vote in 18 of 33 constituencies.
     
            “The voters have spoken and they have voted for stability, for continuity, for certainty - and they voted to give Prime Minister Lawrence Wong a strong mandate,” said Mustafa Izzuddin, adjunct senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore.
     
            Although a PAP defeat was always extremely unlikely, some analysts had said the election could have altered the future political dynamic if the opposition had made more gains, with some younger voters keen for fresh voices, greater scrutiny and more robust debate.
     
            But that could take time. Like previous elections, Saturday’s was a lopsided affair, with 46% of all candidates representing the PAP.
     
            The ruling party ran in all seats, compared to just 26 for the Workers’ Party, which won the 10 seats PAP did not win.
     
            The PAP has a big membership to draw from, influence in state institutions and far greater resources than its untested opponents.
     
            Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the PAP’s decisive win came down to Singaporeans backing a known quantity at a time of uncertainty.
     
            “It’s a flight to safety - not wanting to change to a new party amidst the greatest global trade tensions in decades,” he said.
     
            “Just because they are a rock in times of trouble - the same issues are there (that) they need to address.”

            US President Donald Trump’s efforts to “rebalance” global trade have spooked Wall Street, disquieted US Treasuries and sent investors rushing to buy gold. They have now also roiled a normally staid corner of financial markets, with major potential implications for the future of the US dollar and the global economy.
     
            Since Friday, Taiwan’s currency has gained about 8% against the greenback, according to Refinitv data, an extraordinary amount over just two trading sessions because of speculation that the island has had to make trade-related concessions to the White House.
     
            And even though things are now calmer, Monday’s surge was the largest daily percentage gain in about four decades, according to Reuters, which was all the more surprising because the island’s central bank likes to keep things stable and quiet.
     
            The gyrations in Taiwan — and also in nearby Hong Kong, a city with a currency market that similarly tends to avoid the limelight — demonstrate how Trump’s trade war has already had far-reaching consequences.
     
            Yang Chin-long, governor of Taiwan’s central bank, was forced to convene a hastily arranged press conference late on Monday to shoot down rumors that the Trump administration had asked the island to strengthen its currency against the US dollar in exchange for tariff exemptions during ongoing trade talks.
     
            “Stock market commentators are urged not to comment … in a speculative manner to avoid affecting the order and stability of Taiwan’s foreign exchange market and even affecting the real economy,” he said in a statement.
     
            On Sunday, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that his administration was meeting with “almost” every country, and some trade deals “could very well be” announced this week.
     
            Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, also weighed in, calling reports about a deal with the US on exchange rate policy “false news” on Monday. A stronger currency would make Taiwanese products more expensive compared to the US dollar, which would make Taiwan’s exports less competitive.
     
            The island is one of the most important nodes in the global technology supply chain because it is home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces more than 90% of the world’s advanced microchips powering everything from smartphones and artificial intelligence to weapons.
     
            It’s been a “stunning” couple of days for the Taiwan dollar, said Sean Callow, a senior foreign exchange analyst at ITC Markets, who believes the US dollar’s “increasingly tarnished global reputation should leave (it) trending lower against most currencies.”
     
            That would make US products cheaper and more competitive overseas, which would tally with Trump’s larger strategy to restore US manufacturing dominance. In that case, Asian economies would have to accept that their currencies would inevitably appreciate against the greenback and their exports would be affected, too.
     
            In Hong Kong, its de-facto central bank said in a statement on Tuesday that it had spent $60.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($7.8 billion) to buy US currency, a record daily amount according to Bloomberg, after the Hong Kong dollar once again hit the strong end of its trading band.
     
            The former British colony still pegs the value of its currency to that of the US dollar. It’s an arrangement that dates back almost four decades and has long been considered a guarantee of financial stability and prosperity.

            A few months ago, the words “bonded warehouse” and “harmonized system codes” might not have been on the minds of many American business owners. Now they’re in a massive spotlight.
     
            After President Donald Trump slapped a whopping 145% minimum tariff on most goods coming from China, 25% tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum and steel and a 10% tariff on almost every country’s imports, US businesses are desperate for ways to lower their import costs.
     
            Two popular — and legal — strategies involve those bonded warehouses to defer tariffs and harmonized system codes to qualify for lower rates.
     
            There are over 5,000 different product classification codes that governments across the globe use when assessing tariffs.
     
            Consumers don’t care whether the imported coat they’re wearing was officially classified as a windbreaker or a raincoat.
     
            But for businesses, that distinction can be the difference between lower and higher tariff rates – and potentially turning a profit or not. And to qualify for the lower rate, all a manufacturer would have to do is tinker with the product’s materials, otherwise known as tariff engineering.
     
            For instance, Converse’s signature All Stars sneakers have a sole that contains felt as opposed to the fully rubber one traditionally seen in sneakers. That may have been a purposeful decision, since foreign-produced shoes with felt bottoms could be considered “house slippers” for the purpose of tariff codes. And house slippers have qualified for significantly lower tariff rates compared to other kinds of footwear in the past. (Nike, the parent company of Converse, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment. CNN could not determine the latest tariff rates for sneakers versus house slippers given their respective classification codes.)
     
            Columbia Sportswear has not been shy about its use of tariff engineering. “I have a whole team of people that work … with the designers and developers and merchandisers and with customs, actually, and to ensure that during the design process that we’re considering the impact of tariffs,” Jeff Tooze, the vice president of global customs and trade at Columbia Sportswear told Marketplace in 2019.
     
            Among its uses of tariff engineering: adding small zippered pockets below shirt waistlines to qualify for lower tariff rates, he said.
     
            Even in the current environment, with Trump’s efforts to target tariffs at China and specific sectors, there are still plenty of opportunities for businesses to tariff engineer products, said Erik Smithweiss, a partner at the law firm GDLSK, who specializes in trade compliance.
     
            While there’s little way out of the initial 20% tariff Trump levied on China earlier this year, there are some opportunities to avoid the additional 125% that came into effect last month. That’s because Trump has, in some cases, quietly exempted some products from those tariffs.
     
            “We are working with companies who say, ‘Gee, I really want to be on this list, look at my tariff codes,’” said Smithweiss. “If we think that there is something that can be modified on a product that will change it into one of these exempt codes, we’ll work with them on whether that is a reasonable position to take.”
     
            But just slapping a new code on a product isn’t enough; the product itself has to be different in some way. US Customs and Border Protection agents can examine goods closely, including, for instance, sending fabrics out to labs to see if they meet applicable requirements, Smithweiss told CNN. If it doesn’t, the importer can be subject to a penalty on top of the higher tariff.
     
            The bonded warehouse route takes the opposite approach. Rather than mess with a good’s contents or move production elsewhere, businesses can import products from across the world without paying any tariffs when they enter the US — as long as they remain locked up in a special customs-regulated warehouse.
     
            Businesses can keep goods in these warehouses for up to five years without paying a tariff. They only pay the current tariff rate when they take goods out of storage.
     
            It’s a bet that tariff rates will go down in the short or medium term.
     
            Jennifer Hartry, president of Howard Hartry, a customs broker that rents out bonded warehouses, told CNN’s Julia Vargas Jones that 95% of the inquiries she’s received are for goods coming from China.
     
            Hartry said her family-owned business based by the Port of Los Angeles experienced a stark slowdown in recent years, but, since Trump introduced a slew of aggressive new tariffs, business has been booming.
     
            There’s no limit to the monetary value of the goods stored in bonded warehouses — the only constraint is how much a business can fit in the space they’re renting.
     
            For example, Hartry said the value of her tenants’ goods ranges from $37,000 to half a million dollars. Those goods include lithium batteries, metal rods and electronics such as TVs and treadmills.
     
            Hartry said it’s not lost on her how much of a toll tariffs are taking on businesses. At the same time, she told CNN’s Vargas, “it’s saving our business, which we’re grateful for.

Follow: 
            Japan and China have accused each other of violating the airspace around the Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands, which Beijing also claims.
     
            The latest territorial flap came as both appeared to have warmer ties while seeking to mitigate damages from the US tariff war.
     
            Japan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement it lodged a “very severe protest” with Beijing after a Chinese helicopter took off from one of China’s four coast guard boats, which had entered Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands. The helicopter violated Japanese airspace for about 15 minutes on Saturday, the ministry said.
     
            The statement called the incident an “intrusion … into Japan’s territorial airspace” and urged the Chinese government to ensure preventive measures.
     
            Japan’s Self-Defense Force scrambled fighter jets in response, according to the Defense Ministry.
     
            China also protested to Tokyo over a Japanese civilian aircraft violating its airspace around the islands, saying it was “strongly dissatisfied” about Japan’s “severe violation of China’s sovereignty,” according to a statement by the Chinese Embassy in Japan late Saturday.
     
            China Coast Guard said it “immediately took necessary control measures against it in accordance with the law” and dispatched a ship-borne helicopter to warn and drive away the Japanese aircraft.

            Japanese officials are investigating a possible connection between the Chinese coast guard helicopter’s airspace intrusion and the small Japanese civilian aircraft flying in the area around the same time.
     
            China routinely sends coast guard vessels and aircraft into waters and airspace surrounding the islands, which China calls the Diaoyu, to harass Japanese vessels in the area, forcing Japan to quickly mobilize its jets.
     
            Saturday’s intrusion was the first by China since a Chinese reconnaissance aircraft violated the Japanese airspace off the southern prefecture of Nagasaki in August. Chinese aircraft have also violated the Japanese airspace around the Senkaku twice in the past.

            One of America’s closest allies recently raised eyebrows for threatening to fire off the ultimate financial weapon against Washington in trade talks: dumping US debt.
     
            Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, whose country is the biggest holder of US Treasuries, said on Friday that selling the assets is a “card on the table” in tariff negotiations, according to The Associated Press.
 
            “It does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,” Kato said.

The clock is ticking down to zero, and Trump needs a trade deal — badly
 
            Two days later, the Japanese official walked back the comment, stressing on Sunday that the longtime US ally is “not considering the sale of US Treasuries as a means of Japan-US negotiations.”
     
            Japan was unlikely to fire this big bazooka in the trade war anyway, since selling US Treasuries is considered an extreme move — one that would likely backfire, experts say. Still, the short-lived threat raises an ugly truth: The United States relies on other countries buying its $36 trillion mountain of debt.
     
            It’s another way that President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade war could hurt the American economy: Tariffs have the potential to reduce the amount of capital seeking a home in American assets, which could lift interest rates and hurt the value of the US dollar. Even if a large-scale Treasury selloff is unlikely, other nations — including one of America’s closest allies — are clearly considering all options.
     
            As America’s biggest foreign creditor, Japan sits on $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries. That gives Tokyo some leverage as it seeks to hammer out a trade deal with the White House.
     
            If Japan sold massive amounts of US debt, it would very likely spark a massive Treasury selloff. Treasury rates would in turn sharply increase, making it more expensive for Washington to borrow and freaking out investors along the way.
     
            “It would send shockwaves around world financial markets if one of the most reliable buyers of Treasuries is no longer reliably in the market for it,” said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale and a chief economist in the Biden administration.
     
            Recall that fears of a bond market catastrophe helped convince Trump to pause so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on April 9.
     
            And Washington doesn’t just rely on Japan to buy its debt.
     
            China has been slapped with tariffs of at least 145% on most goods, but it is also America’s second-biggest foreign creditor, with $784 billion of Treasuries as of February, according to federal data.
 
            The United Kingdom, which faces a 10% tariff, is America’s third-largest foreign creditor, with $750 billion of US Treasuries. And the sixth-biggest holder of US Treasuries, Canada, is being threatened with more tariffs if it does not join the United States as the 51st state.
     
            But for these nations, dumping US debt, especially in a fire sale, would risk destabilizing global markets as well as their own.

            Moreover, it would hurt their own investments and that of their banks and citizens. Their own currencies could also sharply increase in value, making it harder to sell their goods overseas.
     
            “Threatening to dump an asset of which it is a major holder means that Japan can hurt itself in the process,” Win Thin, global head of market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He wrote that this kind of threat is “always a double-edged sword.”
     
            Maury Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN that Japan’s comments seem “very rash” and amount to “just a silly response.”
     
            “No one wants to sell a lot of Treasuries quickly because they would take losses on their entire portfolio, and Japan’s is vast,” Obstfeld said. “This would also invite massive tariff retaliation.”
     
            Moreover, as Obstfeld notes, Japan needs Washington to defend itself in the volatile Asia-Pacific region. It wouldn’t want to do anything to cast doubt on that support from the American military.
     
            “The fact is that US Treasuries are so central to world financial markets that it’s really hard to damage the United States – without hurting yourself in the process,” said Yale’s Tedeschi.
     
            Still, the warning from Japan does speak to a broader issue.
     
            “Both theory and data show that trade tariffs reduce net capital inflows,” said Kent Smetters, professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.
     
            Smetters, who runs the Penn Wharton Budget Model, noted that capital was indeed leaving the United States and rates were rising before Trump announced his pause on reciprocal tariffs.
     
            “If the tariffs are fully implemented, the US will need to sell its future debt… at lower prices and higher yields,” Smetters said. “More tax cuts, instead of helping offset some of the negative effects of tariffs, will add to the debt at a time when it will become more costly to do so.”

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/06/travel/sas-eurobonus-millionaires-flight-challenge,"They became millionaires – in frequent flyer points | CNN

            Who knew becoming a millionaire was so easy?
     
            When European airline SAS, or Scandinavian Airlines, switched airline “alliance” in late 2024, it decided to make a song and dance about it, creating frequent flyer “millionaires” in the process.
     
            For 27 years, the airline had been part of the Star Alliance, an umbrella collection of 25 global carriers including stalwarts of the sky like United, Singapore Airlines and Ethiopian.
     
            But last year SAS — based in Copenhagen, with Stockholm and Oslo its other major hubs — switched to SkyTeam, which counts Delta, Virgin Atlantic and Air France-KLM among its members.
     
            Airline alliances have long been beloved of frequent flyers, who can take “codeshare” flights on any airline in the group, while still earning points and miles on their preferred airline’s program.
     
            So for an airline to switch alliance can be a seismic shift for travelers with engrained flying patterns.
     
            “[We’d had] 27 years of telling customers, ‘Go with this airline because they’re the best’ — so our customers were really used to using, say, United on a US domestic trip,” says Aron Backström, VP of product and loyalty at SAS.
     
            “Those habits are really engrained. And now we have a new set of partners — really high quality, but not as known to Scandinavian customers and not part of our members’ habits. So we felt the need to shake that up, and do something big to create some excitement and willingness to try them out.”
     
            The team came up with a challenge: members of their EuroBonus frequent flyer program who flew with 15 different SkyTeam airlines between October 8 and December 31 would receive one million EuroBonus points — worth around $10,000 in potential flights.
     
            Almost 50,000 of the eight million members of the EuroBonus program signed up for the challenge. Around 7,000 of them were new members who’d joined the program specifically to complete the challenge.
     
            Around 900 made it to the end and became millionaires. One of them was a member from Norway who’d joined EuroBonus when the program launched, 33 years ago. Another was a mother-daughter couple looking to spend quality time together.
     
            Here, two of them share their experience — and explain why it wasn’t for the fainthearted.
     
            Of the frequent flyers taking part in the challenge, around 30% were women — a heavy gender disparity if you judge it by real-world standards, but pretty promising for frequent flyer circles, which tend to be male-dominated.
     
            Nara Lee, a 36-year-old travel YouTuber from Chuncheon, South Korea, was one of them. It was her first toehold in the world of frequent flying.
     
            “I wasn’t really aware of airline alliances,” she says. “This experience introduced me to how they work.”
     
            She knew nothing about SAS, but as soon as she heard about the challenge — halfway though the qualifying period, in mid-November — she wanted to do it.

Frequent flyers have spent years staying loyal to airlines. Now airlines are giving them ‘the middle finger’
 
            “I was a nail artist for 15 years, but ever since I was young, my dream had always been to travel the world,” she says.
     
            “Last year, I finally started traveling abroad. However, since I don’t speak English well, I ended up only joining package tours.
     
            “One day, I came across a video about the SAS challenge on YouTube, and my heart started racing. Even though I had no experience booking international flights on my own and couldn’t speak English, I was filled with the desire to take on this challenge no matter what. I wanted to earn one million miles and finally make my childhood dream of traveling the world a reality.”
     
            Lee spent over 160 hours in the air, flying economy, to bag her miles. Her route took her through Asia, across to the Americas, over the Atlantic to Europe, and onwards to southeast Asia before returning to Seoul.
     
            Since bagging her million miles, she’s already put them to good use. In March, she spent 127,500 flying to Paris and back with Air France — and this time she did so in business class. In April, she jetted off to Ho Chi Minh City for 70,000 miles, flying economy on the way out, and business back. All pretty much for free — paying around $155 and $95 in taxes respectively.
     
            Another unlikely flyer taking to the skies was Barry Collins. The 44-year-old from Eastbourne, in the UK, has been an “avid” collector of airline points for the past decade, accruing them through regular shopping and using them to pay for ‘free’ flights.
     
            When Collins read about the challenge on frequent flyer website Head for Points, it was “the right thing at the right time.” He’d recently wound up his business, and though he has fingers in other pies, “I was at a loose end, shuffling round the house.” It was, he says, a “midlife crisis.”
     
            His wife, Cheryl, was encouraging him to go on a solo trip. She would send him missives advising him, “You need to just piss off and climb up the Andes or something,” he says. But although Collins had traveled to backpacker destinations when younger, he didn’t want to go on a group trip.
     
            With Cheryl’s blessing, when he read about the challenge, he realized it was something that would give him a sense of achievement — and something he could do alone. “It scratched an itch,” he says now.
     
            Collins’ cardinal rule was that he would only fly economy — his aim was to get a return on  his investment, and he felt flying business would be less of a challenge. “Lying flat and sipping champagne is different to roughing it in the cheap seats,” he says ruefully.
     
            Another non-negotiable: He would only take hand luggage. Checking a bag across multiple connections “would possibly have led to a disaster,” he says.
     
            Third rule: Instead of flying straight in and out, he would stop over in destinations that were new to him.
     
            “I’ve been to America 100 times, and to Mexico but never Seoul or Vietnam,” he says. “That interested me more than going back somewhere I’d been before. I had school runs to do.”
     
            Which leads us to his final rule: That this challenge must not derail real life. Instead of doing one round-the-world trip, Collins went back and forth from the UK, taking regional trips in tranches.

            For his trip to the US and Mexico via France — all destinations he already knew — he departed on the Friday morning and was back on Sunday night and on hand to take the kids to school on Monday.
     
            He started with a family vacation in Madrid. Then he tackled European airlines, flying to Paris, Bucharest (where he stayed overnight), and back via Amsterdam and Stockholm.
     
            Next up was that weekend race around Atlanta, Mexico City and Paris again.
     
            And his fourth and final trip was an odyssey through the Middle East and Asia: Jeddah, Jakarta, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City, Taipei, Xiamen, Shanghai, Seoul, Guangzhou, Bangkok, Shanghai again, and back to London Gatwick.
     
            In total he took 22 flights on 19 airlines, 16 of which were SkyTeam. Little wonder he says the challenge was keeping going physically.
     
            So what did their odysseys teach our two intrepid travelers?
     
            Firstly, how to sleep on an airplane. Collins’ accessory of choice was a specially shaped TRTL travel pillow. He paired that with an eyemask, and recommends either headphones or earplugs.
     
            If you want to sleep, he suggests stopping drinking an hour before the flight, then going to the bathroom one final time as you board.
     
            “The best tip for sleeping on a plane is simply being exhausted,” jokes Lee. “If economy feels too uncomfortable to sleep in, that probably means you’re not tired enough yet. I was so tired that I could sleep anywhere without any special tricks.”
     
            The pair — who never crossed paths — also appreciated the culture shocks the trips gave them.
     
            For Collins, Jeddah airport confounded his expectations of Saudi Arabia. “They all spoke perfect English, there were signs in both Arabic and English, and the airport and lounge were great,” he says — although he didn’t travel onwards in the country, but connected straight out.
     
            He also loved Seoul and Bucharest, and is already planning a return for a city break in the latter. “It had Communist-era concrete blocks, but then you’d stumble into the Old Town with cobbled streets, cafes and bars,” he says.
     
            As for airports, he loved the calm of Stockholm and Amsterdam, but found the waiting times at Bucharest and Ho Chi Minh City trying. A special mention goes to the US Department of Homeland Security, which quizzed him heavily. “Americans have a knack — they use the word ‘sir’ or ‘ma’am’ and make you feel uncomfortable,” he says. It was the polar opposite of immigration staff in Jakarta who waved him through when he hadn’t realized he needed to buy a tourist visa.
     
            “One of the benefits of traveling as a white middle-aged, middle class man is they don’t bother with you,” he says. The same goes for finding accommodation — a crucial way he kept his costs down.
     
            “In Ho Chi Minh City a taxi driver dropped me off on the main road and pointed to an alleyway. I had to go down it and turn left onto an even smaller alleyway. The privilege of being a middle-aged white guy is that I can say yeah, I’m fine with that, which maybe a woman wouldn’t feel comfortable doing. I felt really comfortable wandering around Taipei on my own in the middle of the night. I’m not sure a solo female traveler would have the same experience.”

            Indeed, Lee had to plan her trip more precisely. She often slept at airports, but “always stayed in crowded areas or used 24-hour cafes and restaurants.”
     
            She didn’t go out late at night but was “constantly on alert.”
     
            Her scariest moment was in New York. “In Korea, you rarely see people under the influence of drugs, but in New York, it was quite common. Nobody threatened me but just seeing people in that state was intimidating,” she says.
     
            Finally, they both learned to change their plans on the hoof when things went wrong. Due to some confusion with the promotion, some flights (like Collins’ Delta flight to Atlanta) weren’t counted as part of the offer. He had to reroute from Seoul to Guangzhou to add in another carrier — Kenya Airways, which flies Guangzhou-Bangkok.
     
            Lee, meanwhile, was caught up in a severe storm leaving Seoul for her first flight. She ended up stuck on her China Eastern plane for 10 hours, missing her next two connecting flights, on China Airlines and XiamenAir. While she was told she’d be rebooked and hosted in a hotel, it didn’t happen. Instead, she had to get herself to Guangzhou to pick up her Kenya Airways flight to Bangkok.
     
            When the pair added up their final costs, they’ve both “earned” thousands of dollars in airline points which they can now convert into flights.
     
            Collins spent £4,784.54 ($6,185.13) in total, the bulk of which (£3,947.88 or $5,103.55) was on flights. By staying in basic, independently run hotels, he spent less on accommodation (£234.47) than he did on parking at London’s Heathrow airport (£256.70).
     
            Lee spent 5,000,000 Korean won (around $3,800) on flights and around 1,000,000 won ($760) on food and accommodation.
     
            Their flights, one after the other, elicited some quick favorites and least favorites, too. Collins rates China Eastern as best value: “What you got for what you paid was phenonemonal.” XiamenAir, conversely, was his worst-value flight, and his least favorite was Kenya Airways: “It wasn’t bad, just not great. It was a bit tatty round the edges, I had to hold my headphones in the headphone port.”

            Lee loved Korean Air for the lack of language barrier and Garuda Indonesia: “The crew members were incredibly warm and welcoming, and that alone made my entire flight experience feel special.” Her least favorite? KLM, for a noisy Bucharest-bound flight. “The crew did nothing to manage the noise level. Also, I still remember the in-flight meal — a sandwich — which was quite underwhelming,” she says.
     
            So was it all worth it?
     
            For SAS, certainly. Backström says that the cost of creating 900 “millionaires,” essentially gifting each one $10,000 in flights (to be confirmed in a couple of years once the miles have been used), has already paid back in brand awareness. Lee, for example, has gone from not knowing SAS to being a fully paid-up fan, just in time for them to launch their Copenhagen-Seoul route in September. Traffic on the airline’s SkyTeam subsite saw a “huge increase,” Backström says, and it’s seen a boost in interest from the US, China, and South Korea in particular.
     
            Of course, it has received pushback for encouraging flying at a time of climate crisis, but Backström says that the people who took the challenge were “already planning to travel a lot.”
     
            “We’re an airline, we can’t be ashamed of marketing our product,” he says.
     
            Lee, who’d never been previously interested in frequent flyer programs, is now a SkyTeam aficionado. “Now every SkyTeam airline feels like a familiar neighbor,” she says. “Whenever I board a flight, I can almost picture my past self, curled up in a corner seat, exhausted from my SAS run. After everything we’ve been through together, I feel like I won’t be flying with other airlines as much anymore.”
     
            As soon as her points were deposited, she booked that trip to Paris. She had connected through Charles de Gaulle airport on her millionaire mission.
     
            “Even though I only saw the airport, I remember being totally captivated — it felt like I was inside a concert hall,” she says. “But back then, I was exhausted and definitely not looking my best. That moment made me promise myself, ‘Next time, I’ll come back wearing something nice and flying business class.’ So it was a dream come true. Sitting in business class felt surreal.”
     
            For Collins, who has yet to redeem any miles was a route out of a period of feeling low.
     
            “I feel like it’s made a massive difference,” says his wife, Cheryl. “Before he went, he was a bit sad. He’s always been emotionally steady and this was the first time in 12 years seeing him sad. Now he’s up for it all again. That confidence is back, that swagger.”
     
            It’s also, of course, a tale he’ll tell for the rest of his days.
     
            “The best stuff happens when you’re doing something a bit bonkers,” he says. “You look back on thing with rose-tinted glasses. You don’t think about how your body was shaking at being awake for 30 hours, and if you fall asleep and miss one flight the house of cards would all fall down.
     
            “You don’t think about how you were going to be sick and were hallucinating because you were so tired. You think about the chicken shop in Seoul at midnight.
     
            “Do the daft thing to get the anecdote.”

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/05/asia/kashmir-valley-pakistan-india-tensions-loc-trek-intl-robertson-cmd,"Grief and fear permeate the picturesque Kashmir valleys that separate India and Pakistan | CNN
Follow: 
            Malik Khadim’s lips tremble, his voice chokes and his head dips as he raises a hand to his grief-stricken face. It’s a vain effort to stem the tears gushing down his gaunt and weatherbeaten cheeks.
     
            Khadim is a farmer who lives on the Pakistani side of the de-facto border in the disputed Kashmir region known as the Line of Control, or LoC, between India and Pakistan. As so many civilians on both sides of this conflict have done, he is currently grieving the loss of a loved one. In this case, his brother.
     
            Two weeks ago, gunmen stormed a mountain resort in the Indian controlled part of Kashmir killing 26 people, mostly Indian tourists. The killings sparked widespread public revulsion across India and this already heavily militarized remote border region has been on edge ever since.

US urges restraint as Kashmir massacre tensions put India and Pakistan on edge
 
            The day after the April 22 massacre, Indian officials announced that two Pakistanis planning a terror attack had been shot dead near Khadim’s village on the Indian side of the LoC. That day, when Malik Farouk, Khadim’s brother, didn’t show up after taking out cattle the family reported him as missing, later identifying him from images of the two men released by Indian authorities, a Pakistani security source told CNN.
     
            Both Khadim and Farouk’s son deny that allegation, saying that he was, like them, an impoverished farmer, chasing cattle who strayed toward the unmarked and unfenced LoC in the nearby forest.
     
            In response to the tourist massacre, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to chase the “terrorists” to “the ends of the earth.” India was quick to blame Pakistan, Pakistan denied involvement, and tensions have mounted since.
     
            Both sides have expelled each other’s diplomats and civilians, as well as closed airspace to each other’s airlines. India has also withdrawn from the 1960 Indus Water Treaty that has tempered the tempestuous relations here for decades.
     
            Officials on the Pakistani side of the border have said they expect India to attack and vow, as a matter of “military doctrine,” to respond.
     
            The current language in Islamabad is tougher than this reporter remembers when here covering the Kargil War of 1999. That high-altitude, monthslong border battle, just one of several wars and skirmishes over Kashmir, killed more than a thousand troops, according to the most conservative calculations, the year after Pakistan joined India in becoming a nuclear armed nation.
     
            In the words of a senior Pakistani security official, now is “the moment” to change the dynamic in relations with India, as political relations with New Delhi have at times improved but military attitudes have toughened in recent decades.
     
            Alongside skirmishes with India, Pakistan’s military also has fought – and still fights – an intense Islamist militant insurgency along the country’s western border. And the candid conversations that CNN has had with both senior and lower-level security officials suggested that Pakistan’s army is both mentally and militarily more hardened than before.
     
            The military-facilitated trip that CNN took over the remote and rugged Himalayan mountains to Khadim’s village of Sarjiwar was both beautiful and terrifying.
     
            Boulder-strewn tracks at altitudes of more than 10,000 feet threaded through snowfields, around fresh rock falls and through forests of the towering native Deodar cedar tree. At times, their giant trunks appeared to offer the only potential salvation from one wrong move and a plunge over terrifyingly precipitous drops into raging rivers below.
     
            Just a few hours of this bone-jarring journey are enough to understand why neither Pakistan nor India have ever claimed a decisive victory here. It is just too rugged for an easy win.
     
            Yet both nations want this region, to control all the water that torrents down from its snowcapped peaks. And, despite the challenging terrain, several million people split across the LoC call this disputed land home.
     
            Life is hard here: Elderly women and children haul huge bundles of sticks off the vertiginous slopes; rudimentary farms elbow for room among the mighty Deodar; and meager villages cling to the hillsides where skinny water buffalo, a prized procession here, scavenge for grass.
     
            By comparison, the village of Sarjiwar, which lies lower down the mountain and is populated with roughhewn wood and rock houses, has a sense of permanence. But living at the LoC has put its residents at the sharp end of the rising tensions. Khadim told CNN that Indian troops on front-line posts a few hundred meters from the villagers’ houses shoot at them at night.
     
            Another villager told us that his extended family has taken to living in one house, adding that: “(the) elderly, children and women are incredibly scared we want to take our livestock to pasture but the Indians shoot… it’s our only livelihood… and we have nowhere else to go.”
     
            No shots were fired over the two hours that this CNN team was in Sarjiwar, but both India and Pakistan have reported near daily exchanges of fire across the LoC since last month’s attack on tourists.
     
            Khadim, who is 55 and was born in Sarjiwar, said the whole village is increasingly on edge, adding that residents want to take their few cattle to summer pastures – as they normally would at this time of year – but can’t because they fear being shot by Indian troops.
     
            His biggest fear, however, is that his brother’s death is only a harbinger of a worse fate to come, and that he’ll lose not just beloved family members but his lifelong home and livelihood. “India’s done a great cruelty to us,” he told CNN. “If they want me to leave, put a bullet in my head, that’s the only way I’ll go.”
     
            India has long accused Pakistan of harbouring militant groups who have conducted attacks inside its territory and not doing enough to crack down on them. And there is significant public pressure on Prime Minister Modi to respond to the latest massacre with force.
     
            After a major insurgent attack on paramilitary personnel inside Indian-administered Kashmir in 2019, Modi did just that with India conducting airstrikes inside Pakistan for the first time in decades and both sides fighting a brief dogfight in the skies above Kashmir. After frantic international diplomacy, a full-scale war was ultimately averted.
     
            Civilians here fear that today’s war of words between Islamabad and New Delhi will soon erupt into real conflict. On both sides of Kashmir’s line of control, people feel powerless as their politicians rehash old arguments, potentially reigniting decades of smoldering resentment.

            Despite being dead for more than 300 years, this Indian ruler is still making waves in the nation’s politics.
     
            Aurangzeb Alamgir has become so central to India’s fraught political moment, his memory is leading to sectarian violence across the country.
     
            The sixth emperor of the famed Mughal dynasty, he is considered by many detractors to be a tyrant who brutalized women, razed Hindu temples, forced religious conversions and waged wars against Hindu and Sikh rulers.
     
            And in a nation now almost entirely under the grip of Hindu nationalists, Aurangzeb’s “crimes” have been seized upon by right-wing politicians, turning him into the ultimate Muslim villain whose memory needs to be erased.
     
            Sectarian clashes erupted in the central city of Nagpur last month, with hardline Hindu nationalists calling for the demolition of his tomb, which is about 400 kilometers away.
     
            Seemingly spurred on by a recent Bollywood movie’s portrayal of Aurangzeb’s violent conquests against a revered Hindu king, the violence led to dozens of injuries and arrests, prompting Nagpur authorities to impose a curfew.
     
            As tensions between the two communities continue to mount, many right-wing Hindus are using Aurangzeb’s name to highlight historical injustices against the country’s majority faith.
     
            And they are causing fears among India’s 200 million Muslims.
     
            The Mughals ruled during an era that saw conquest, domination and violent power struggles but also an explosion of art and culture as well as periods of deep religious syncretism – at least until Aurangzeb.
     
            Founded by Babur in 1526, the empire at its height covered an area that stretched from modern-day Afghanistan in central Asia to Bangladesh in the east, coming to an end in 1857 when the British overthrew the final emperor, Bahadur Shah II.
     
            Its most well-known leaders – Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan – famously promoted religious harmony and heavily influenced much of Indian culture, building iconic sites such as the Taj Mahal and Delhi’s Red Fort.
     
            But among this more tolerant company, Aurangzeb is considered something of a dark horse – a religious zealot and complex character.
     
            Aurangzeb “evoked a mixture of admiration and aversion right from the moment of his succession to the Mughal throne,” said Abhishek Kaicker, a historian of Persianate South Asia at UC Berkeley.
     
            “He attracted a degree of revulsion because of the way in which he came to the throne by imprisoning his father and killing his brothers… At the same time, he drew admiration and loyalty for his personal unostentatiousness and piety, his unrivaled military power that led to the expansion of the Mughal realm, his political acumen, administrative efficiency, and reputation for justice and impartiality.”
     
            Born in 1618 to Shah Jahan (of Taj Mahal fame) and his wife Mumtaz Mahal (for whom it was built), historians describe the young prince as a devout, solemn figure, who showed early signs of leadership.
     
            He held several appointments from the age of 18, in all of which he established himself as a capable commander. The glory of the Mughal empire reached its zenith under his father, and Aurangzeb scrambled for control of what was then the richest throne in the world.
     
            So when Shah Jahan fell ill in 1657, the stage was set for a bitter war of succession between Aurangzeb and his three siblings in which he would eventually come face-to-face with his eldest brother, Dara Shikoh, a champion of a syncretic Hindu-Muslim culture.
     
            Aurangzeb imprisoned his ailing father in 1658 and defeated his brother the year after, before forcibly parading him in chains on a filthy elephant on the streets of Delhi.
     
            “The favorite and pampered son of the most magnificent of the Great Mughals was now clad in a travel-tainted dress of the coarsest cloth,” wrote Jadunath Sarkar in “A Short History of Aurangzib.”
     
            “With a dark dingy-colored turban, such as only the poorest wear, on his head. No necklace or jewel adorning his person.”
     
            Dara Shikoh was later murdered.
     
            By now, Aurangzeb’s authority had reached extraordinary heights, and under his leadership the Mughal empire reached its greatest geographical extent.
     
            He commanded a degree of respect and for the first half of his reign, ruled with an iron fist, albeit with relative tolerance for the majority Hindu faith.
     
            Until about 1679, there were no reports of temples being broken, nor any imposition of “jizya” or tax on non-Muslim subjects, according to Nadeem Rezavi, a professor of History at India’s Aligarh University. Aurangzeb behaved, “just like his forefathers,” Rezavi said, explaining how some Hindus even held high rank within his government.
     
            In 1680 however, that all changed, as he embraced a form of religious intolerance that reverberates to this day.
     
            The zealot ruler demoted his Hindu statesmen, turning friends into foes and launching a long and unpopular war in the Deccan, which included the violent suppression of the Marathas, a Hindu kingdom revered to this day by India’s right-wing politicians – including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
     
            Members of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been quick to point out the cruelties inflicted on Hindus by Aurangzeb – forcing conversions, reinstating the jizya, and murdering non-Muslims.
     
            He also waged war on the Sikhs, executing the religion’s ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur, an act makes Aurangzeb a figure of loathing among many Sikhs to this day.
     
            This brutality was on display in the recently released film “Chhaava,” which depicts Aurangzeb as a barbaric Islamist who killed Sambhaji, the son of the most famous Maratha king, Chhatrapati Shivaji.
     
            “Chhaava has ignited people’s anger against Aurangzeb,” said Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra, where Nagpur is located.
     
            Muslims alleged members of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) burned a sheet bearing verses from their holy Quran.
     
            Yajendra Thakur, a member of the VHP group, denied the allegations but restated his desire to have Aurangzeb’s tomb removed.
     
            “Aurangzeb’s grave should not be here,” he told CNN from Nagpur. “It shouldn’t be here because of everything he did to Shambhaji Maharaj. Even our Muslim brothers should issue a statement saying that Aurangzeb’s grave should not be in Nagpur.”
     
            Modi’s invocation of the man who led India before him is no surprise.
     
            The prime minister, who wears his religion on his sleeve, has been a long-time member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates the establishment of Hindu hegemony within India. It argues the country’s Hindus have been historically oppressed – first by the Mughals, then by the British colonizers who followed.
     
            And many of them want every trace of this history gone.
     
            The Maharashtra district where he is buried, once known as Aurangabad, was renamed after Shivaji’s son in 2023. The triumphs of his forefathers, the great king Akbar and Shah Jahan, have been written out of history textbooks, Rezavi said, or not taught in schools.
     
            “They are trying to revert history and replace it with myth, something of their own imagination,” Rezavi said. “Aurangzeb is being used to demonize a community.”

Clashes erupt in western India as Hindu groups demand demolition of Mughal ruler’s tomb
 
            Modi’s BJP denies using the Mughal emperor’s name to defame India’s Muslims. But his invocation of India’s former rulers is causing fear and anxiety among the religious minority today.
     
            While historians agree that he was a dark, complex figure, and don’t contest his atrocities, Rezavi said it is necessary to recognize that he existed at a time when “India as a concept” didn’t exist.
     
            “We are talking about a time when there was no constitution, there was no parliament, there was no democracy,” Rezavi said.
     
            Kaicker seemingly agrees. Such historical figures “deserve neither praise nor blame,” he said.
     
            “They have to be understood in the context of their own time, which is quite distant from our own.”
     
            Back in Nagpur, demands for the tomb’s removal have gone unanswered, with some members of the Hindu far right even dismissing the calls for demolition.
     
            Local Muslim resident Asif Qureshi said his hometown has never seen violence like that which unfolded last month, condemning the clashes that convulsed the historically peaceful city.
     
            “This is a stain on our city’s history,” he said.

            The chief executive of Korean Air, one of the world’s top airlines, has a stark warning about the impact of US President Donald Trump’s trade war on some of the carrier’s most popular routes.
     
            “We’re already seeing the downturn in passenger volume between trans-Pacific (routes) and also to Europe,” Walter Cho told CNN this week, just steps away from a gleaming Boeing 777 decked out in the airline’s distinctive blue and white colors. “It’s subtle, maybe 5% compared to last year, but it has some significant impact to our business.”
     
            When asked how the decline translates into dollars, Cho indicated it could cost Korean Air anywhere between $50 million to $100 million a year in lost revenue if lower passenger levels continue for the rest of 2025.
     
            “Korea’s economy is in between the US and China, and we depend on both economies as well, quite a bit,” Cho said.
     
            “We are bracing for the impact we’re looking at. I don’t expect this year to be great for the Korean economy, and we are looking at our costs as we speak. But I hope, I hope I’m wrong,” he added.
     
            Korean Air, which completed the acquisition of rival Asiana Airlines in December, isn’t the only major airline to warn about the impact of tariffs.
     
            Delta Air Lines said in April that revenue could fall in the current quarter and “growth has largely stalled.” Delta, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have all stopped providing full-year financial forecasts due to the uncertainty.
     
            Still, Cho remains optimistic. He said he believes the trade war will end “soon” and that Korean Air will remain in the black. He partially attributed the slowdown in traffic along the European and Pacific routes to increased competition, as travel returns to pre-Covid levels.
     
            As US-based airlines from United to Southwest cut back on flight schedules, South Korea’s flagship carrier plans to maintain all its routes to America.
     
            Cho confirmed Korean Air will move forward with plans to reintroduce Airbus A380 flights from Seoul to Los Angeles in the summer, and Boeing 747 flights from Seoul to Atlanta.
     
            “I looked at the reservation data for the summer; it’s very strong,” he said. “Starting June, mid-June, everything is full, all the way up to the first week of September.”
     
            “There’s still demand for each route, and we cannot change our schedule just because traffic is down 5-10%,” Cho continued. “So, we’re going to have to hold on to them.”
     
            Trade war headwinds will be difficult for the industry to ignore, however. Advisory firm Tourism Economics projects under an expanded trade war scenario, international inbound visits to the US could decline by 12.7% this year, leading to a $22 billion annual loss in inbound travel spending.
     
            Outside the US, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) says global travel demand appears resilient. In an April interview with Reuters, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said that while trade-related uncertainty is never welcome, the aviation industry has historically managed such disruptions.
     
            Transatlantic travel rose in January and February compared to the same period last year, Walsh said, and overall global demand remains roughly 9% above pre-pandemic levels. “It’s not obvious that there’s been an impact,” Walsh said, noting data for March and April has not yet been received.
     
            But a tumultuous tariff environment could also spell trouble for cargo flights, which are a sizable portion of Korean Air’s business. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the carrier hollowed out passenger planes and reconfigured them into cargo freighters.
     
            The pivot to a business model focused on shipping and trade during the nadir of the pandemic-induced economic shock in 2020 helped save the airline, Cho said. For a vastly different tariff-related shock in 2025, Korean Air’s cargo operations may have to look for new markets.
     
            “It’s kind of tough, because about 40% of our business, Korean Air business, is in cargo, and that will get impacted severely when the tariff actually hits Korea and also China,” Cho said.
     
            “So, I’m not planning to downsize our cargo. We’re going to refocus our volume to Europe and other places where demand will still be. Also, I’ve been seeing a lot of trade between China and Canada, for example. We could focus on those markets as well,” he added.
     
            Korean Air is potentially vulnerable because South Korea manufactures a high volume of semiconductor chips bound for the US, according to Shukor Yusof, founder of Singapore-based Endau Analytics, an advisory firm that focuses on the aviation industry.
     
            Although the Trump administration has so far exempted semiconductors, smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts from tariffs, uncertainties linger.
     
            “They are feeling the heat,” Yusof said.
     
            In March, Korean Air finalized its biggest order from Boeing ever: up to 50 widebody airplanes, including 20 Boeing 777-9s and 20 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners with options for 10 additional Dreamliners.
     
            The planes will be powered by GE Aerospace engines, a combined $32 billion deal hailed by the White House.

            “Yes, but you know, I was always a Boeing fan, so to speak,” Cho said. “There’s only two choices (the other being Airbus), I always trusted Boeing, and I always go to Boeing for my needs.”
     
            Cho said the decision to buy the Boeing planes was made last year, before Trump’s second term in office. He said his decision to sign off on the blockbuster agreement in Washington indicates strong ties between Korean Air and US manufacturing.
     
            Despite headlines in recent years highlighting problems at Boeing, from a blown-out 737 MAX 9 door plug over Portland, Oregon, to allegations of quality control issues, Cho said he will continue to trust the American aerospace giant well into the future.
     
            Even at a potentially perilous time for the global economy, Cho said planned upgrades to all Korean Air cabins will not be paused.
     
            After the US greenlighted the airline’s long-anticipated merger with Asiana in December, Cho said a goal of the larger airline would be to catch up with the quality and luxury offered by global rivals such as Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways.
     
            “We’re not cutting back,” Cho said. “I believe it’s a long-term investment. Once I gain the trust of the customer, they’ll come back.”
     
            Legroom in Korean Air’s relatively spacious economy seating will not be reduced. Upgrades to lounges at New York’s JFK, Seoul’s Incheon and Los Angeles’ LAX will not be put on hold, even as recession fears grow.
     
            “I felt that all passengers should have some comfort, even if they are flying economy,” Cho said. “So, we are maintaining our seat pitch, much bigger than the industry standard, and we’re introducing new catering for everybody, including new Korean cuisine and new entertainment system and Wi-Fi.”
     
            Within three to four years, Cho expects new seating and refurbished cabins to be installed across the entirety of Korean Air’s expanded, post-merger fleet.
     
            “We’re moving as fast as we can, but we have about 150 airplanes that we have to refurbish. And it takes a lot more than we expected due to supply chain issues.”
     
            Cho was candid about the turbulence ahead: a multibillion-dollar merger, an aggressive fleet overhaul and a global trade war that threatens to erode Korean Air’s revenue.
     
            “It’s a lot of money,” he acknowledged, reflecting on the airline’s most ambitious transformation in decades. “But it’s been 43 years since we changed. It’s about time.”
     
            At a moment when many global carriers are retrenching, Cho is making a calculated and consequential bet: that enduring ties with the US and sustained investments in the passenger experience will help Korean Air navigate a trade war storm, one with no clear end in sight.

Follow: 
            Multiple major airlines are avoiding flying over Pakistan as relations with neighbor India crater in the wake of a recent tourist massacre, the latest geopolitical flashpoint to disrupt global travel.
     
            Air France said it has suspended flying over the South Asian country until further notice because of the “recent evolution of tensions between India and Pakistan” in a statement to CNN.
     
            The airline is “adapting its flight schedule and flight plans to and from certain destinations,” the French flag carrier said, adding some routes will require longer flight times, it said.
     
            Germany’s flag carrier Lufthansa also confirmed to Reuters that it was “avoiding Pakistani airspace until further notice.”

Grief and fear permeate the picturesque Kashmir valleys that separate India and Pakistan
 
            The travel disruptions come two weeks after militants massacred 26 civilians, mostly tourists, in the mountainous town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, a rampage that has sparked widespread outrage.
     
            India was quick to blame Pakistan, which it has long accused of harboring militant groups. Pakistan denied involvement, and tensions have mounted since with a series of escalatory tit-for-tat moves between the two neighbors.
     
            Both sides had already closed their airspaces to each other’s aircraft since the attack, but the increased tensions are now impacting other international airlines and will likely cost them as they burn extra fuel taking longer routes.
     
            The disruptions could compound expenses for airlines, who have already had to be cautious about other key flashpoints in recent years, including the Middle East and areas close to the Ukraine-Russia front lines.
     
            Flight-tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates traveling over the Arabian Sea and then turning north toward Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, Reuters reported.
     
            Kashmir, one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints, is controlled in part by India and Pakistan but both countries claim it in its entirety. Since their independence from Britain nearly 80 years ago, the two nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars over the mountainous territory that is now divided by a de-facto border called the Line of Control (LOC).
     
            In the wake of the tourist massacre, India and Pakistan have been flexing their military muscle, putting both countries on edge.
     
            Pakistan on Monday carried out a second missile test in three days, Reuters reported.
     
            The Pakistani army said the missile tested was a Fatah series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometers (75 miles), according to Reuters. It came two days after the successful launch of a surface-to-surface ballistic missile.
     
            India has also ordered all its states and union territories to carry out mock security drills on Wednesday – a rare order from the home ministry not seen in decades covering 244 areas categorized as “civil defense districts.”
     
            It comes days after India’s navy said it had carried out test missile strikes to “revalidate and demonstrate readiness of platforms, systems and crew for long range precision offensive strike.”
     
            Tensions have ramped up despite the United States and China urging restraint.
     
            The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, on Monday also urged both India and Pakistan to “avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control.”
     
            “Make no mistake:  A military solution is no solution,” he added.
     
            The UN Security Council held a closed door meeting on Monday, according to a statement from Pakistan’s foreign ministry.
     
            Water has become a key flashpoint in the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.
     
            India suspended its involvement in the Indus Water Treaty days after the militant attack, threatening a pact that has been in place since 1960.
     
            The treaty governs the sharing of water from the enormous Indus River system, a vital resource supporting hundreds of millions of livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India. The Indus originates in Tibet and flows through China and Indian-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan.
     
            Indian media citing government sources earlier reported that New Delhi had cut water flowing through the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir, stopping water flowing into Pakistan via the Chenab river.
     
            In response to those reports, a Pakistani government source on Tuesday told CNN that authorities “are aware that India has started work on hydro projects” since suspending the treaty.
     
            “Pakistan has also protested in this regard, but India has started work without giving any response,” the sources said. CNN has contacted India for a response.
     
            The military stand-off could threaten Pakistan’s economy, which has already suffered major challenges in recent years.
     
            “Sustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan’s growth and hamper the government’s ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan’s progress in achieving macroeconomic stability,” a report from Moody’s said, according to Reuters.

US urges restraint as Kashmir massacre tensions put India and Pakistan on edge
 
            Pakistan recently secured a $7 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund after years of negotiations, giving the country some much-needed respite following years of economic turmoil as a result of political instability and climate catastrophes.
     
            “A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan’s access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves,” the Moody’s report said, according to Reuters.
     
            India, on the other hand, is not expected to see major disruptions to its economy since it has “minimal economic relations” with Pakistan, Moody’s added.
     
            As military tensions ramp up, cultural exchanges between New Delhi and Islamabad have also come to a halt.
     
            India has blocked the social media handles of Pakistani celebrities and a much-anticipated Indian film featuring a Pakistani actor is now not expected to release in the country.

Pakistani star’s Bollywood return excites fans and riles far right
 
            Fawad Khan, an actor, singer and producer with a huge following in India, announced his Bollywood comeback in April, sending fans into a frenzy. But his upcoming movie, “Abir Gulaal,” will not hit cinemas on May 9 as previously planned, according to local media reports.
     
            Khan’s impending return to Bollywood was hailed as heartening news by Indian critics and fans alike.
     
            The actor, who has appeared in Indian films in the past, disappeared from Indian screens in 2016 after dozens of Indian soldiers were killed in a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that was followed by deadly clashes along the contested border.
     
            India blamed Pakistan for that attack, which Islamabad denied, and as tensions escalated between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association imposed a de-facto ban on Pakistani talent.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/06/china/china-greenland-footprint-us-suspicion-intl-hnk,"Trump says the US needs to protect Greenland from China. Are his fears overblown? | CNN

            Throughout his second term, US President Donald Trump has trained his focus on a sprawling but sparsely populated island that stretches into the Arctic circle.
     
            The United States needs that island – Greenland, a territory of US ally Denmark – “very badly,” Trump said in an NBC interview that aired on Sunday, echoing comments he’s made repeatedly in recent months.
     
            “Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security,” he said, while adding, when asked, that he would not “rule out” taking the island by force.
     
            Trump’s justification? There were Russian and Chinese boats, “gun ships all over the place — aircraft carriers, gun ships — going up and down the coast of Greenland,” he said Sunday. “We need that to be protected.”
     
            Vice President JD Vance laid a similar assessment during a visit to the US’ singular military installation on the island, the Pituffik Space Base, in March.
     
            The base, which lies some 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle, was not well protected from “aggressive incursions” from Russia and China, Vance told troops during an address at that time.
     
            “Denmark has not kept pace in devoting the resources necessary to keep this base, to keep our troops, and, in my view, to keep the people of Greenland safe from a lot of very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China and from other nations,” Vance said – a claim Denmark disputes.
     
            The Trump administration’s interest in Greenland appears to be part of what Washington sees as a broader competition for power in the Arctic, where Russia is a dominant force and China aspires to expand its footprint and capabilities.
     
            But, when it comes to Greenland, experts are puzzled by the administration’s characterization.
     
            Chinese firms, like others, have mounted efforts to develop expensive and geologically challenging mining projects on the resource-rich island. They’ve also bid on constructing airfields there – initiatives observers see as linked to Beijing’s broader aims to enhance its role in the Arctic and gain control of critical minerals.
     
            But those projects have all fizzled, experts say, either due to business reasons or as governments in both Greenland’s capital Nuuk and US NATO partner Copenhagen rebuffed them, at times reportedly under pressure from Washington.
     
            That’s left “almost no Chinese footprint in Greenland,” outside a limited presence in the fishing industry, according to Andreas Østhagen, a senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway, who added: “There is no evidence of any ‘aggressive incursions’ by any actor in Greenland, at least not publicly available.”
     
            And while experts say that there is Russian military activity across regional northern seas and China has scaled up naval activities off Alaska in recent years, in addition to its research and commercial operations in the broader Arctic, there’s been no publicly known signs of Chinese military vessels operating in the waters around Greenland.
     
            Unless the administration provides more details, “I assume that Trump and his advisors are conflating various trends taking place in ‘the Arctic,’ but which in fact take place in specific (other) parts” in and around the Arctic, said Østhagen.
     
            When a reporter asked JD Vance earlier this year if he had been briefed on specific threats from China and Russia on Greenland and if these were military in nature, Vance said he didn’t “want to get too specific.”
     
            “But we know the Chinese are very, very interested in this island. We have seen some of the economic pressures they have tried to place on Greenland. We know that they are increasingly engaging in military training and military interests certainly. They have started to describe themselves as a ‘near Arctic power’ – part of that is justifying taking a firm interest in Greenland and some of the surrounding territories,” he said, in reference to the “near Arctic state” term that China has used for more than a decade.
     
            “We have seen very strong evidence that both the Chinese and the Russians are interested in Greenland. Why wouldn’t they be interested in Greenland?” he added.
     
            When asked to comment on Trump administration statements, Beijing has said “relations between countries should be handled in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN.” It’s also defended its adherence to “basic principles of respect, cooperation, win-win result and sustainability in engaging in Arctic affairs.”
     
            Close observers agree that China has looked to ramp up ties and investment in the island since the early 2000s – and has many reasons to be interested.
     
            Greenland is rich in minerals important to the fabrication of military and high-tech goods, and, as Arctic ice melts, sea lanes alongside it are expected to become more important for global shipping.
     
            The island and its adjacent waterways are also strategically important to the US – and its rivals. Washington’s military base plays a critical role detecting missile threats and conducting space surveillance.
     
            Russia, a dominant military force in the Arctic with an expansive Arctic Ocean coastline, is seen by observers and US intelligence as interested in nearby naval routes, which form a key strategic chokepoint stretching from Greenland toward the United Kingdom.
     
            When it comes to China, “I’ve yet to see any coast guard vessels, any naval vessels, let alone aircraft carriers” in waters near Greenland, said Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, noting that Chinese aircraft carriers are “confined to the Pacific Ocean.”
     
            Chinese researchers have written about the island’s potential importance for its own critical mineral supply chains – as well as its strategic significance as an entry point for China to influence Arctic affairs and actualize its “polar silk road” – a vision to extend leader Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road global infrastructure building drive across the top of the world.
     
            Last year, Beijing dispatched its special representative on European Affairs to Greenland for talks on economic cooperation, while Nuuk in 2021 opened a representation office in Beijing – one of only five globally – and sent delegations to the Chinese capital in the past.
     
            But efforts from Chinese firms to gain a physical foothold in Greenland or access its raw materials have been ill-fated.
     
            Chinese companies did become involved in four major mining projects in Greenland, all initiated between 2009 and 2015, but those have either dissolved or stalled, according to experts and research from the Danish Institute for International Studies.
     
            The most well-known of those projects, at a mine in coastal Kvanefjeld, would have allowed a Chinese-funded Australian venture to operate what the company described as a project with the potential to become “the most significant western world producer of critical rare earths.”
     
            The project, however, was blocked in 2021 when the government restricted mining deposits with certain uranium concentrations, citing environmental concerns. The company has launched an arbitration case and expressed hope that a new government elected earlier this year could look more favorably on the project.
     
            But currently, “China has no footprint at all in Greenland mining,” according to Marc Lanteigne, a professor at the University of Tromsø: The Arctic University of Norway, who described China’s footprint on Greenland is “almost negligible” besides “very limited cooperation in seafood trade.”
     
            Lanteigne also noted how the Danish government, under pressure from the United States, stepped in to finance airport refurbishment projects after a Chinese firm was shortlisted as a potential contractor, with the firm withdrawing its bid.
     
            The Danish government in 2016 also blocked a Hong Kong firm’s bid to purchase an abandoned naval facility. Plans in 2017 from the Chinese Academic of Sciences to build a research station also didn’t get government approval, according to researchers.
     
            Denmark has been “quite diligent” in looking to ensure that Greenland’s economic sovereignty is not “transferred to any degree to China,” said Lanteigne. “There has been a great deal of Danish-American cooperation … to monitor Greenland to make sure that there are no overt security threats.”
     
            Meanwhile, a 1951 agreement allows the US to establish American military bases on the island.
     
            That raises the question of why Washington says it needs to take control of Greenland – an expansionist rhetoric that has echoes of the president’s earlier calls to take control of the Panama Canal, over false claims that China “operates” the key waterway.
     
            Greenland has appeared keen to work with US firms on mining projects and the US’ ability to operate its military on the island would be unlikely to change even if Greenland became independent in the future, observers say.
     
            “The reality is that Greenland, as an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark, has managed its relations to the great powers on its own accord,” said Ties Dams, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute think tank in the Netherlands.
     
            “If Vance’s comments are indeed a prologue to a military incursion by the US, then the US is the real threat to Greenland’s cherished and longstanding autonomy,” he added.
     
            In response to earlier comments from Trump, Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen firmly stated that the US “won’t get” Greenland as Trump has previously suggested.
     
            Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has also said Denmark was “open to criticism” by the US but had already “stepped up” investment in Arctic security and remained open to enhanced cooperation with the United States.
     
            The US, meanwhile, some two weeks after Vance’s visit, announced it had removed Pituffik Space Base commander Col. Susannah Meyers. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said that “actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense,” in a post on X that linked to a Military.com article, an independent outlet, that said Meyers had sent an email to base staff distancing herself from Vance’s visit.
     
            The Trump administration’s focus on Greenland – and China’s in recent years – come amid increasing focus on the Arctic as an arena for rivalry between the world’s great powers.
     
            China announced its Arctic strategy in a 2018 white paper, where it declared itself “an active participant, builder and contributor in Arctic affairs.”
     
            The document also laid out its aims to explore, conduct research and combat climate change in the Arctic – as well as its ambitions to develop shipping routes and become more involved in fishing and resource extraction, while building its polar silk road.
     
            Today, China has built out its ice breaker fleet, operates research stations in Norway and Iceland, and has partnered with international scientists on a range of projects, in additional to some commercial activities in the non-Russian Arctic.
     
            But growing suspicion in Europe about Beijing’s ambitions in the region – and what experts say is the likely dual military use of its scientific data and research missions – have led to similar instances of cancelled or rejected projects elsewhere in Europe.
     
            “China is in a position now where pretty much its only entry ticket to the Arctic is through Russia,” said Lanteigne from the University of Tromsø.
     
            China has been an important investor in Russian energy extraction and emerged as a dominant presence on increasingly viable shipping lanes along Russia’s Arctic coastline, though at least some of those operations have been affected by Chinese firms not wanting to run afoul of international sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine.
     
            Meanwhile, there are other areas of the Arctic where Russia genuinely has been making “somewhat aggressive incursions,” according to Østhagen of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute. That’s particularly in “the European Arctic, where Norway and Finland must manage an increasingly belligerent Russian neighbor,” he said. “But there’s not more Russian activity off the coast of Greenland than elsewhere – in fact, there’s less.”
     
            And China has “scaled up its naval – and eventually also airborne – activity off Alaska in recent years,” he added.
     
            Last year, Russian and Chinese jets were spotted for the first time conducting a joint patrol near Alaska. Months later, Chinese and Russia coastguards also had a first joint patrol in Arctic waters, according to Chinese state media. The two countries have also conducted joint exercises in the Baltic Sea in Europe and the Bering Strait between Russia and Alaska in past years.
     
            But observers say Russia is likely to remain wary of a Chinese security presence in its Arctic region, and Beijing is likely to continue to focus on looking for ways to engage economically, scientifically and diplomatically in the broader region.
     
            That’s especially as Beijing expects the US to try “to push China off that area of the map,” according to Dams of the Clingendael Institute.
     
            China “will resist absolutely, trusting the US strategy of clinging to supremacy will fail on its own accord, if only given time,” he said.

            Another day, another piece of evidence that President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war with friends and foes is hurting the global economy. Today: Japan’s central bank cut its economic growth forecast for the country in half.
     
            The Bank of Japan on Thursday lowered its expectations for 2025 gross domestic product growth to an anemic 0.5%, down from the previous projection of +1.1%, made in January. It also cut its growth forecast for next year to 0.7%, down from the previous projection of +1.0%.
     
            “Japan’s economic growth is likely to moderate, as trade and other policies in each jurisdiction lead to a slowdown in overseas economies and to a decline in domestic corporate profits and other factors,” Japan’s central bank said in a statement.
     
            The bank noted, however, that the on-again, off-again trade war has clouded its outlook.
     
            “It is extremely uncertain how trade and other policies in each jurisdiction will evolve and how overseas economic activity and prices will react to them,” it said.
     
            Japan is at the top of the list of countries with which the Trump administration said it is negotiating a trade deal.
     
            Trump at a NewsNation town hall event Wednesday said he has reached “potential” trade agreements with Japan, South Korea and India, which would replace punishing “reciprocal” tariffs, although he did not provide details of those new deals.
     
            But Trump also pooh-poohed the urgency of doing trade deals, noting, “They want us. We don’t need them.” He also said he wasn’t in a hurry to complete any deal.
     
            It’s highly unlikely that the United States and Japan, though allies, would be able to reach a complex new trade agreement quickly, anyhow. However, the Trump administration has repeatedly said it is in active talks with more than a dozen countries and expects to reveal at least some memoranda of understanding about negotiating terms for revised trade deals in the coming days and weeks.
     
            Japan’s forecast came a day after the US Commerce Department reported that the trade war hurt economic growth, sending America’s economy into slight contraction in the first quarter. Consumer spending decelerated during the quarter and businesses stockpiled imported goods ahead of tariffs. That meant imports exceeded exports, dragging down GDP growth.
     
            Also on Wednesday, China reported that its factory activity contracted in April at the fastest pace in 16 months because of America’s massive tariffs on its goods and China’s significant retaliatory tariffs on American imports.
     
            The International Monetary Fund last month warned that the global trade war will stymie growth, particularly in the United States.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/10/asia/south-north-korea-dmz-wildfire-intl-hnk,"South Korean helicopters fight wildfire along heavily armed border with North Korea | CNN
Follow: 
            South Korea sent two helicopters to battle a wildfire inside the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), Seoul’s military said Friday, adding it had warned North Korea in advance of its firefighting mission along the heavily armed border area.
     
            The blaze in the east of the DMZ dividing the Koreas comes just weeks after South Korea suffered record deadly wildfires in the country’s southeast that forced communities to evacuate and destroyed thousands of structures, including a centuries-old Buddhist temple.
     
            South Korea’s military aired broadcasts to North Korea to warn people there about the helicopters early Friday, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
     
            “Our military is maintaining readiness while closely monitoring North Korean activities,” the Joint Chiefs added.
     
            It’s unclear what caused the fire, which started Thursday afternoon in South Korea’s eastern Goseong county, Gangwon province, according to authorities.
     
            The Korea Forest Service said the blaze had been about half extinguished as of Friday morning, while the military said firefighting efforts were “proceeding smoothly” and there had been no damage to South Korean personnel or facilities.
     
            The DMZ is a no-man’s land about 30 miles north of Seoul that was established in the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement to provide distance between the two sides and prevent military brush-ups. The 160-mile-long, 2.5-mile-wide DMZ is one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world and both Seoul and Pyongyang maintain large numbers of troops there. It has been the site of high-level discussions on inter-Korea relations and is also a major tourist attraction.
     
            Largely devoid of human activity, the DMZ has inadvertently become one of the most pristine environments in Asia and a haven for wildlife. In 2023, Google released street-view images of the DMZ for the first time, offering a rare glimpse into the flora and fauna that inhabit the peaceful buffer.
     
            Inter-Korea hostilities have ramped up in recent years as North Korea appears to have intensified its nuclear production efforts and strengthened ties with Russia as it wages war in Ukraine. Last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea.
     
            Earlier this week, South Korea’s military said it had fired warning shots after North Korean soldiers crossed the military demarcation line before retreating.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/02/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-tensions-vance-rubio-intl-hnk,"India-Pakistan tensions: Vance, Rubio urge restraint as Kashmir attack puts countries on edge | CNN
Follow: 
            The United States is stepping up pressure on India and Pakistan to avoid conflict in Kashmir after a tourist massacre in an Indian-administered area of the divided territory last week.
     
            US Vice President JD Vance said Thursday that Washington hopes Pakistan will help hunt down the militants behind the attack as well as any other terrorist groups who he said “sometimes” operate from within Pakistan.
     
            India has long accused Pakistan of harboring militant groups that have conducted attacks against it, including in Kashmir, something Islamabad has long denied.
     
            Vance also urged India, which has vowed to pursue the tourist massacre attackers “to the ends of the earth” to act with restraint so tensions do not explode into a war between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
     
            “Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn’t lead to a broader regional conflict,” Vance said in an interview on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier.”
     
            “And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with.”
     
            Vance’s comments echoed those of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who on Wednesday spoke with top Pakistani and Indian officials and called on the two rivals to work with each other to “de-escalate tensions,” according to State Department readouts of the two calls.
     
            Rubio “expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam, and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,” in his call with Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
     
            In his call with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Rubio “spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22,” and urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in the investigation.
     
            “Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence,” the readout said.
     
            Fears of a broader conflict increased earlier this week when Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said his country had “credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours.”
     
            That timeframe has now passed.
     
            Militants on April 22 massacred 26 civilians, the vast majority tourists, in the mountainous town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, a rampage that has sparked widespread outrage.
     
            India and Pakistan have since engaged in tit-for-tat hostilities.

            India closed its airspace to commercial flights from Pakistan on Tuesday, matching Islamabad’s ban on flights from India, which was imposed last week in response to New Delhi’s cancelation of visas for Pakistani nationals and suspension of a key water sharing treaty.
     
            This week, New Delhi and Islamabad have both been flexing their military might.
     
            Pakistan shot down an Indian drone that was used for “espionage” in the disputed Kashmir region on Tuesday, Pakistani security sources told CNN.
     
            Two days earlier, India’s navy said it had carried out test missile strikes to “revalidate and demonstrate readiness of platforms, systems and crew for long range precision offensive strike.”
     
            Tensions have also been simmering along the de facto border, the Line of Control, in Kashmir, and gunfire was exchanged along the disputed border for seven straight nights.
     
            Meanwhile, Pakistani authorities continue to believe an Indian attack is highly likely a a senior Pakistani official told CNN on Friday.
     
            The official said four Indian fighter jets flew close to Pakistani airspace in the direction of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir on what Pakistani authorities assessed to be an attack mission early Wednesday, but rather than cross the border, diverted to a nearby base. The official noted that Pakistani jets were also in the area. CNN cannot independently verify the allegations.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Indian government, army and air force for comment on the official’s allegations.
     
            The official also praised efforts by the Trump administration to defuse tensions as even-handed and helpful.
     
            Kashmir, one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints, is controlled in part by India and Pakistan but both countries claim it in its entirety.
     
            The two nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars over the mountainous territory that has been divided since their independence from Britain nearly 80 years ago.
     
            India conducted airstrikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following a major insurgent attack on paramilitary personnel inside Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the first such incursion into Pakistan’s territory since a 1971 war between the two neighbors.
     
            The latest attack on tourists in Kashmir has sparked fears that India might respond in a similar way.
     
            Conditions may be ripe for greater conflict now than was seen in 2019, according to Steven Honig and Natalie Caloca, researchers at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
     
            Writing on the CFR website, the two said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has “made the transformation and stabilization of Kashmir a central pillar of his legacy”
     
            They said Modi was hurt politically by the 2019 attacks inside Indian-administer Kashmir and will likely feel pressure to be more assertive with New Delhi’s response this time.
     
            Both countries are heavily armed, though in any conventional conflict, India holds a large advantage.
     
            The Indian defense budget is more than nine times Pakistan’s, according to the “Military Balance 2025” from the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
     
            That budget supports an active-duty Indian force of almost 1.5 million personnel, compared to just 660,000 for Pakistan.
     
            On the ground, India’s 1.2 million force army has 3,750 main battle tanks and more than 10,000 artillery pieces, while Pakistan’s tank force is only two-thirds of India’s and Islamabad has fewer than half of the artillery pieces in New Delhi’s arsenal.
     
            At sea, the Indian navy’s advantage is overwhelming.  It has two aircraft carriers, 12 guided-missile destroyers, 11 guided-missile frigates and 16 attack submarines.
     
            Pakistan has no carriers and no guided-missile destroyers, with 11 smaller guided-missile frigates being the backbone of its naval fleet. It also has only half the number of subs that India fields.
     
            Both air forces rely heavily on older Soviet-era aircraft, including MiG-21s in India and the Chinese equivalent – the J-7 – in Pakistan.
     
            While overall numbers of air-to-air fighter jets and ground-attack aircraft sway heavily in India’s favor, both militaries have been making recent efforts to update their air forces with modern fourth-generation aircraft.
     
            India has been investing in multirole French-made Rafale jets, with 36 now in service, according to the Military Balance.
     
            Pakistan has been adding Chinese J-10 multirole jets, with more than 20 now in its fleet.
     
            Though Pakistan still has dozens of US-made F-16 fighters, the backbone of its fleet has become the JF-17, a joint project with China that came online in the early 2000s. About 150 are in service.
     
            Despite acquiring the Rafales from France, Russian-made aircraft still play a significant role in India’s air fleet. More than 100 MiG-29 fighters are in service with the air force and navy combined. And more than 260 Su-30 ground attack jets bolster India’s force.
     
            The rivals are closer in capabilities when it comes to nuclear forces – with around five dozen surface-to-surface launchers each – though India has longer range ballistic missiles than Pakistan.
     
            India also has two nuclear-capable submarines while Pakistan has none.

            India accuses Rana of conspiring to carry out one of the country’s deadliest attacks, when 10 Pakistani men associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba killed more than 160 people during a four-day rampage through Mumbai that began on November 26, 2008.
     
            That date is etched in the memory of the nation and is often referred to as India’s 9/11.
     
            The attackers traveled to Mumbai by boat from the Pakistani port city of Karachi, hijacking a fishing trawler and killing its five crew members along the way. The men then docked at the waterfront near the iconic Gateway of India monument and split into at least three groups to carry out the attacks, according to police.
     
            Using automatic weapons and grenades, they targeted the city’s largest train terminal, the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and the Oberoi Trident hotels, the popular Leopold restaurant, a Jewish community center, and a hospital.
     
            Nine of the 10 terrorists were killed by police during a cat-and-mouse chase across the city. The lone surviving gunman, Ajmal Kasab, was executed in 2012.
     
            Rana, who lived in the US at the time, is accused by New Delhi of conspiring with the terrorists and providing them with information required to carry out their attack. He previously denied similar accusations in a US court.
     
            India’s federal investigative agency has charged Rana with several crimes, including attempting to wage war, murder and forgery. If found guilty, the 64-year-old could face the death penalty.

            On Thursday, the country’s National Investigation Agency confirmed Rana’s extradition, writing in a statement that he was sent to India after he exhausted all legal avenues to stay in the US.
     
            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Rana would “face justice” for his role in the “horrific” Mumbai terror attacks, in a statement on Friday.
     
            “The United States has long supported India’s efforts to ensure those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice. As President Trump has said, the United States and India will continue to work together to combat the global scourge of terrorism,” Rubio said.
     
            In 2011, a US court acquitted Rana of conspiracy to provide material to support the Mumbai attackers, but he was found guilty of two other charges, including providing material support to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.
     
            He was serving a 14-year sentence in a Los Angeles jail for those charges when his extradition was approved earlier this week.
     
            India’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said the US Supreme Court had rejected Rana’s plea to stay his extradition, but did not answer further questions about the case.

            Ruma was having lunch on a summer day in 2021 when her phone began blowing up with notifications.
     
            When she opened the messages, they were devastating. Photos of her face had been taken from social media and edited onto naked bodies, shared with dozens of users in a chat room on the messaging app Telegram.
     
            The comments in screen shots of the chat room were demeaning and vulgar – as were the texts from the anonymous messenger who had sent her the images. “Isn’t it funny? … Watching your own sex video,” they wrote. “Tell me you honestly enjoy this.”
     
            The harassment escalated into threats to share the images more widely and taunts that police wouldn’t be able to find the perpetrators. The sender seemed to know her personal details, but she had no way to identify them.
     
            “I was bombarded with all these images that I had never imagined in my life,” said Ruma, who CNN is identifying with a pseudonym for her privacy and safety.
     
            While revenge porn – the nonconsensual sharing of sexual images – has been around for nearly as long as the internet, the proliferation of AI tools means that anyone can be targeted by explicit deepfakes, even if they’ve never taken or sent a nude photo.
     
            South Korea has had a particularly fraught recent history of digital sex crimes, from hidden cameras in public facilities to Telegram chat rooms where women and girls were coerced and blackmailed into posting demeaning sexual content.
     
            But deepfake technology is now posing a new threat, and the crisis is particularly acute in schools. Between January and early November last year, more than 900 students, teachers and staff in schools reported that they fell victim to deepfake sex crimes, according to data from the country’s education ministry. Those figures do not include universities, which have also seen a spate of deepfake porn attacks.
     
            In response, the ministry established an emergency task force. And in September, legislators passed an amendment that made possessing and viewing deepfake porn punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won (over $20,000).
     
            Creating and distributing non-consensual deepfake explicit images now has a maximum prison sentence of seven years, up from five.
     
            South Korea’s National Police Agency has urged its officers to “take the lead in completely eradicating deepfake sex crimes.”
     
            But of 964 deepfake-related sex crime cases reported from January to October last year, police made 23 arrests, according to a Seoul National Police statement.
     
            Legislator Kim Nam-hee told CNN that “investigations and punishments have been too passive so far.” So, some victims, like Ruma, are conducting their own investigations.
     
            Ruma was a 27-year-old university student when her nightmare first began. When she went to the police, they told her they would request user information from Telegram, but warned the platform was notorious for not sharing such data, she said.
     
            Once an outgoing student who enjoyed school and an active social life, Ruma said the incident had completely changed her life.
     
            “It broke my whole belief system about the world,” she said. “The fact that they could use such vulgar, rough images to humiliate and violate you to that extreme extent really damages you almost irrevocably.”
     
            She decided to act after learning that investigations into reports by other students had ended after a few months, with police citing difficulty in identifying suspects.
     
            Ruma and fellow students sought help from Won Eun-ji, an activist who gained national fame for exposing South Korea’s largest digital sex crime group on Telegram in 2020.
     
            Won agreed to help, creating a fake Telegram account and posing as a man in his 30s to infiltrate the chat room where the deepfake images had circulated. She spent nearly two years carefully gathering information and engaging other users in conversation, before coordinating with police to help carry out a sting operation.
     
            When police confronted the suspect, Won sent him a Telegram message. His phone pinged – he had been caught.
     
            Two former students from the prestigious Seoul National University (SNU) were arrested last May. The main perpetrator was ultimately sentenced to 9 years in prison for producing and distributing sexually exploitative materials, while an accomplice was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison.
     
            Police told CNN further investigations identified at least 61 victims, including 12 current and former SNU students. Seoul National University, in a briefing after the incident, said “the school will strengthen preventative education to raise awareness among the members of the university about digital sex crimes and do its best to protect victims and prevent recurrence.”
     
            Excerpts of the ruling shared by Ruma’s lawyers state, “The fake explicit materials produced by the perpetrator are repugnant, and the conversations surrounding them are shocking … They targeted victims as if they were hunting prey, sexually insulted the victims and destroyed their dignity by using photos from graduations, weddings, and family gatherings.”
     
            In response to the verdict, Ruma told CNN, “I didn’t expect the ruling to align exactly with the prosecution’s request. I’m happy, but this is only the first trial. I don’t feel entirely relieved yet.”
     
            Ruma’s case is just one of thousands across South Korea – and some victims had less help from police.
     
            One high school teacher, Kim, told CNN she first learned she was being targeted for exploitation in July 2023, when a student urgently showed her Twitter screenshots of inappropriate photos taken of her in the classroom, focusing on her body.
     
            “My hands started to shake,” she recalled. “When could this photo have been taken, and who would upload such a thing?”
     
            CNN is identifying Kim by her last name only for her privacy and safety.
     
            But she said the situation worsened two days later. Her hair was made messy, and her body was altered to make it look like she was looking back. The manipulated picture of her face was added onto nude photos. The sophisticated technology made the images unnervingly realistic.

South Korea to criminalize watching or possessing sexually explicit deepfakes
 
            Police told her that their only option to identify the poster was to request user information from Twitter, the social media platform bought by Elon Musk in 2022 and rebranded as X in 2023, with an emphasis on free speech and privacy.
     
            Kim and a colleague, also a victim of a secret filming, feared that using official channels to identify the user would take too long and launched their own investigation.
     
            They identified the person: a quiet, introverted student “someone you’d never imagine doing such a thing,” Kim said.
     
            The person was charged but regardless of what happens in court, she said life will never be the same.
     
            She said a lack of public empathy has frustrated her too. “I read a lot of articles and comments about deepfakes saying, ‘Why is it a serious crime when it’s not even your real body?’” Kim said.
     
            According to X’s current policy, obtaining user information involves obtaining a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal document and submitting a request on law enforcement letterhead via its website.
     
            X says it’s company policy to inform users that a request has been made.
     
            Its rules on authenticity state that users “may not share inauthentic content on X that may deceive people or lead to harm.”
     
            Won, the activist, said that for a long time, sharing and viewing sexual content of women was not considered a serious offense in South Korea.
     
            Though pornography is banned, authorities have long failed to enforce the law or punish offenders, Won said.
     
            Societal apathy makes it easier for perpetrators to commit digital sex crimes, Won said, including what she called “acquaintance humiliation.”
     
            “Acquaintance humiliation” often begins with perpetrators sharing photos and personal information of women they know on Telegram, offering to create deepfake content or asking others to do so. Victims live in fear as attackers often know their personal information – where they live, work, and even details about their families – posing real threats to their safety and allowing anonymous users to harass women directly.
     
            Since South Korea’s largest digital sex exploitation case on Telegram in 2020, Won said the sexual exploitation ecosystem had fluctuated, shrinking during large-scale police investigations but expanding again once authorities ease off.
     
            The victims CNN interviewed all pushed for heavier punishment for perpetrators. While prevention is important, “there’s a need to judge these cases properly when they occur,” Kim said.
     
            Online platforms are also under pressure to act.
     
            Telegram, which has become a fertile space for various digital crimes, announced it would increase sharing user data with authorities as part of a broader crackdown on illegal activities.
     
            The move came after the company’s CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in August in France on a warrant relating to Telegram’s lack of moderation, marking a turning point for a platform long recognized for its commitment to privacy and encrypted messaging. Durov is under formal investigation but has been allowed to leave France, he said in a post on Telegram.
     
            Last September, South Korea’s media regulator said Telegram had agreed to establish a hotline to help wipe illegal content from the app, and that the company had removed 148 digital sex crime videos as requested by the regulator.
     
                    “This is something that has been delayed for far too long.”
                 
                    Won Eun-ji, Activist & Journalist
                 
            Won welcomed this move, but with some skepticism – saying governments should remove the app from app stores, to prevent new users from signing up, if Telegram doesn’t show substantial progress soon. “This is something that has been delayed for far too long,” she said.
     
            In a statement to CNN, Telegram said the company “has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal pornography” and uses “a combination of human moderation, AI and machine learning tools and reports from users and trusted organizations to combat illegal pornography and other abuses of the platform.”
     
            A meaningful breakthrough occurred this January, marking the first time Korean authorities successfully obtained crime-related data from Telegram, according to Seoul police.

            Fourteen people were arrested, including six minors, for allegedly sexually exploiting over 200 victims through Telegram. The criminal ring’s mastermind had allegedly targeted men and women of various ages since 2020, and more than 70 others were under investigation for allegedly creating and sharing deepfake exploitation materials, Seoul police said.
     
            Meanwhile, victims told CNN they hope other women in their position can receive more support from the police and the courts going forward.
     
            “No matter how much punishments are strengthened, there are still far more victims who suffer because their perpetrators have not been caught, and that’s why it feels like the verdict is still far from being a true realization of change or justice,” Ruma said. “There’s a long way to go.”

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/24/science/china-space-station-pakistani-astronaut-intl-hnk,"Tiangong: Pakistani astronaut will become first foreign national to enter Chinese space station | CNN
Follow: 
            A Pakistani astronaut will become the first foreign national aboard China’s Tiangong space station, as Beijing steps up space diplomacy amid a burgeoning battle with the United States for supremacy in orbit.
     
            The mission of the Pakistani astronaut – who is yet to be selected – tightens already close space ties between Beijing and Islamabad. Last year, Pakistan sent a satellite to the Moon aboard China’s lunar explorer, alongside payloads from the European Space Agency, France, and Italy, according to Chinese state media.
     
            Tiangong is one of two currently operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station, launched in 1998. Since it started operating in 2021, it has only hosted Chinese astronauts.
     
            The mission is “a significant step in the internationalization of the Chinese space station,” said Quentin Parker, an astrophysicist and professor at the University of Hong Kong.
     
            “When you internationalize things properly, you build something greater than the sum of the parts, and that’s true in the internationalization of the space station,” he said.
     
            During a press conference on Wednesday, the China Manned Space Agency announced the astronaut selected will be a payload specialist, handling daily tasks during the mission, as well as scientific experiments for Pakistan.
     
            Amjad Ali, deputy director of Pakistan’s space agency SUPARCO, lauded the news as a milestone for the South Asian nation, whose government is taking a renewed interest in its more than 60-year-old space program.
     
            “It is very important for Pakistan, being the first foreign country whose astronauts are entertained by China and taken by the Chinese mission,” he told Reuters news agency on Wednesday.
     
            Ali said Pakistan space bosses will compile a list of five to 10 candidates for the mission over the next month, for China to then shorten to two.
     
            The pair will then go through training in China for six months to a year, with one eventually being sent to space as early as October next year, while the other acts as a reserve, Ali said.
     
            The two countries’ growing space ties coincide with their increasing economic collaboration and trade on Earth.
     
            Under Beijing’s China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a major project within its broader Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested heavily in infrastructure in the north and south of Pakistan, including a deep-water port in the southwestern city of Gwadar, as well as multiple technological projects between the two countries.
     
            An agreement signed in February between the two countries on space cooperation was a precursor the mission announced Wednesday.
     
            On Tuesday, a delegation from Chinese space tech company Galaxy Space met with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according  to a statement from Sharif’s office.
     
            The delegation expressed a “keen interest in investing in Pakistan’s space technology industry and joint ventures with Pakistani space technology institutions and private telecom companies,” the statement added.
     
            Sharif, calling China his country’s “most reliable friend and strategic partner,” said that Pakistan was “looking to increase cooperation with China in the fields of space technology, space satellites and satellite internet.”
     
            Amer Gilani, who oversees human spaceflight cooperation at SUPARCO, told CNN that the experiments to be conducted during the planned mission were still being selected, but will have “high scientific, industrial and social impact.”
     
            China has rapidly advanced its space power in recent decades through ambitious lunar and deep-space exploration programs, as well as expanding its space station.
     
            On Thursday, another manned mission will launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China, carrying three astronauts to Tiangong.
     
            The Shenzhou-20 crew is scheduled to blast off at 5:17 p.m. on Thursday local time (5:17 a.m. ET), state media reported on Wednesday. It will be the ninth crewed mission headed for China’s space station since it was fully assembled in 2022.
     
            The main purpose of the mission is to complete the in-orbit rotation with the Shenzhou-19 crew, which is scheduled to return to earth on April 29, China Manned Space Agency officials said at a press conference.
     
            While in space, the astronauts will conduct science and application experiments, install a space debris protection device, as well as extravehicular payload and equipment, and perform recovery tasks, according to the agency.
     
            The mission will also carry small animals and organisms for life-science experiments at the space station. They will include zebrafish, flatworms known as planarians, and streptomyces bacteria.
     
            China has signed nearly 200 intergovernmental space cooperation agreements with foreign countries and international organizations, covering fields from satellite development and lunar exploration to manned space flight, state media reported in December.
     
            China’s space administration announced Thursday it has also approved loans of lunar samples collected by China’s earlier moon exploration mission to seven institutions across six countries, including Pakistan.
     
            Parker, from the University of Hong Kong, emphasized the importance of international space cooperation.
     
            “The way that things are in the world at the moment is increasingly complex – but it’s important that this outreach and collaborative spirit is maintained,” he said.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/29/asia/kashmir-pakistan-india-tension-military-intl-hnk,"Pakistan claims it has ‘credible intelligence’ India will strike within 36 hours | CNN
Follow: 
            Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated further after a top Pakistani official claimed early Wednesday to have “credible intelligence” that New Delhi will carry out a military action against Islamabad within the next two days.
     
            The claim came as both the United States and China urged restraint.
     
            “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours,” Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said in an unusual middle of the night post on X. He did not elaborate on what evidence Pakistan had used to make the claim.
     
            Tarar’s comments come just one week after militants massacred 26 tourists in the mountainous town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, a rampage that has sparked widespread outrage.
     
            India has accused Pakistan of being involved in the attack — a claim Islamabad denies. Pakistan has offered a neutral investigation into the incident. CNN has contacted India’s defense ministry for response to Tarar’s claims.
     
            The Director Generals of Military Operations of both countries spoke over a hotline on Tuesday, India’s state broadcaster and Pakistan’s military confirmed on Wednesday - the first conversation between the military officials since the Pahalgam attack.
     
            Kashmir, one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints, is controlled in part by India and Pakistan but both countries claim it in its entirety.
     
            The two nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars over the mountainous territory that is now divided by a de-facto border called the Line of Control since their independence from Britain nearly 80 years ago.

A tourist massacre in Kashmir is escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. Here’s what we know
 
            Last week’s attack sparked immediate widespread anger in India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is under tremendous pressure to retaliate with force.
     
            India conducted airstrikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following a major insurgent attack on paramilitary personnel inside Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the first such incursion into Pakistan’s territory since a 1971 war between the two neighbors.
     
            The latest attack on tourists in Kashmir has sparked fears that India might respond in a similar way.
     
            Modi vowed to pursue the attackers “to the ends of the earth” in a fiery speech last week. The massacre set off an escalating tit-for-tat exchange of hostilities between the two countries over the past week.
     
            Pakistan’s Tarar on Wednesday claimed any “military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.”
     
            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with India’s external affairs minister and Pakistan’s prime minister, urging the two countries to work together to “de-escalate tensions,” according to State Department readouts of the two calls on Wednesday.
     
            In his call with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Rubio “spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22 in Pahalgam” and urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating the attack in the Kashmiri town. Rubio also encouraged Sharif to “re-establish direct communications” with India, the readout said
     
            New Delhi is considered an important partner for Washington as it seeks to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Pakistan is also considered a key US partner.
     
            China, which also claims control of part of Kashmir and has grown closer to Pakistan in recent years, has also urged restraint.
     
            China’s foreign minister Wang Yi spoke to Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar last week, saying any conflict between Pakistan and India would “not serve the fundamental interests of each side” and posed a risk to regional security, state broadcaster CGTN reported.
     
            India and China’s relationship has proved fractious in recent years, with clashes at their contested border. Meanwhile, Beijing and Islamabad have strengthened ties, with China continuing to invest in Pakistan under its Belt and Road Initiative.
     
            In the days after the Pahalgam attack, both countries swiftly downgraded ties with each other.
     
            India canceled visa of Pakistani nationals, and Pakistan responded with a reciprocal move. Both countries have told diplomats and citizens to return home before April 30.
     
            India has also suspended its participation in a crucial water-sharing pact and both sides have now banned each other’s airlines from their respective air spaces.
     
            The Indus Water Treaty has been in force since 1960 and is regarded as a rare diplomatic success story between the two fractious neighbors.
     
            The treaty governs the sharing of water from the enormous Indus River system, a vital resource supporting hundreds of millions of livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India. The Indus originates in Tibet and flows through China and Indian-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan.
     
            Islamabad has called any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan an act of war.
     
            This week, New Delhi and Islamabad have both been flexing their military might.
     
            Pakistan shot down an Indian drone that was used for “espionage” in the disputed Kashmir region on Tuesday, Pakistani security sources told CNN.
     
            Two days earlier, India’s navy said it had carried out test missile strikes to “revalidate and demonstrate readiness of platforms, systems and crew for long range precision offensive strike.”
     
            Tensions have been also been simmering along the Line of Control and gunfire has been exchanged along the disputed border for six straight nights.

            Here’s a look at Kashmir, a region in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges. India, Pakistan and China all claim partial or complete ownership of Kashmir.
     
            Kashmir is an 86,000-square mile region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent.  
     
            India and Pakistan have been fighting over Kashmir since both countries gained their independence in 1947.
     
            Between 1989 and 2008, more than 47,000 people were killed in separatist violence, according to the Indian government. Some human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations say the death toll is higher.
     
            Hundreds are still killed every year in separatist violence, according to human rights groups. 
     
            The Line of Control separates Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir. 
     
            India-controlled: One state, called Jammu and Kashmir, makes up the southern and eastern portions of the region. Srinagar is the summer capital city. Jammu (city) is the winter capital. 
     
            Pakistan-controlled: Three areas called Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan make up the northern and western portions of the region. The capital of Azad Kashmir is Muzaffarabad.
     
            China-controlled: One area called Aksai Chin in the northernmost part of the region.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/05/asia/japan-child-population-fall-intl-hnk,"Japan’s child population has fallen for the 44th year in a row | CNN
Follow: 
            Japan’s estimated child population has shrunk for the 44th straight year to a record low, government data showed Sunday, as the country grapples with a demographic crisis underscored by falling birth rates and a rapidly aging population.
     
            The number of children aged 14 and under, was 13.66 million as of April 1, down 350,000 from a year ago, according to data released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications ahead of the country’s Children’s Day public holiday.
     
            Children make up just 11.1% of Japan’s total population, which stood at 123.4 million last year, marking a marginal decline from the year prior.
     
            By comparison, the proportion of children to the population was roughly 21.7% for the US in 2023 and 17.1% for China in 2024, according to respective government figures.
     
            The demographic crisis has become one of Japan’s most pressing issues, with its birth rate continually declining despite government efforts to encourage young people to get married and start families.
     
            Japan’s fertility rate – the average number of children born to women in their lifetime has stayed relatively flat at 1.3 in recent years – far below the 2.1 required to maintain a stable population.
     
            For decades, it has been on a downward trend that has also seen the number of deaths overtaking births each year, causing the total population to shrink – with far-reaching consequences for Japan’s workforce, economy, welfare systems and social fabric.
     
            In 2024, the country recorded 1.62 million deaths, according to the Health Ministry – more than double the number of births. The number of marriages rose only slightly, up around 10,000 from the year prior, but remained low, figures showed, while the number of divorces also rose.
     
            Experts say the decline is expected to continue for at least several decades and is to some extent irreversible due to the country’s population structure. Japan is a “super-aged” nation, meaning more than 20% of its population is older than 65. The country’s total population stood at 123.4 million in 2024 – but by 2065 it is expected to have dropped to about 88 million.
     
            There are several factors to explain why fewer people are opting to marry and have children, experts say, including Japan’s high cost of living, stagnant economy and wages, limited space, and the country’s demanding work culture.
     
            Japan has a deeply-ingrained overwork culture. Employees across various sectors report punishing hours and high pressure from supervisors, leaving many young people of childbearing age to focus on their careers rather than starting a family.
     
            Increasing living costs, which have been worsened by the weak yen, a sluggish economy and high inflation have contributed to public discontent, experts say.
     
            The government, however, has sought to soften the impacts of its changing demographics, launching new government agencies to focus specifically on boosting fertility rates and incentivizing marriage. It has launched initiatives such as expanding child care facilities, offering housing subsidies to parents, and in some towns, even paying couples to have children.
     
            Several of Japan’s neighbors, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea have also struggled with population decline, as do several European nations such as Spain and Italy. However, unlike many of their East Asian counterparts, European nations have been far more open to immigration to soften the aging of their societies.
     
            China, until recently the world’s most populous country, saw its population fall for a third consecutive year in 2024 with the number of deaths outpacing new births. India has now overtaken China on population size.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/13/asia/north-korea-largest-warship-satellite-photos-intl-hnk-ml,"North Korea is making what could be its largest, most advanced warship ever, new satellite photos show | CNN
Follow: 
            New satellite images show what could be North Korea’s biggest warship ever – possibly more than double the size of anything in leader Kim Jong Un’s naval fleet.
     
            Images taken by independent satellite providers Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs on April 6 show the ship under construction in the water at the Nampo shipyard on North Korea’s west coast, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of the capital Pyongyang.
     
            Analysts say the pictures show ongoing construction of weapons and other internal systems of the ship, which is likely a guided-missile frigate (FFG) designed to carry missiles in vertical launch tubes for use against targets on land and sea.
     
            “The FFG is approximately 140 meters (459 feet) long, making it the largest warship manufactured in North Korea,” an analysis by Joseph Bermudez Jr. and Jennifer Jun at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said.
     
            For comparison, the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are about 505 feet long and its under-construction Constellation-class frigates will be 496 feet long.
     
            The existence of the warship is not a surprise.
     
            The Kim regime has been engaged in a rapid modernization of its armed forces, developing a range of new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach almost anywhere in the United States.
     
            It’s done that despite United Nations sanctions that have puts strict limits on its access to the materials and technology to develop those weapons.
     
            But the closer ties with Russia since the beginning of the Ukraine war could be helping North Korea overcome the UN sanctions, analysts say.
     
            Kim Duk-ki, a retired South Korean admiral, said he thinks Moscow may be providing the technology for the frigate’s missile systems.
     
            Pictures of the vessel appeared in a report by state-run Korean Central Television released late last year on the ruling Workers’ Party’s end-of-year plenary session. The images showed leader Kim inspecting the ship’s construction.
     
            The images in the KCTV video show the warship could have the kind of weaponry possessed by modern navies, including vertical launch cells that could be used to fire a variety of missiles.
     
            Analysts also noted the ship seems to be set up to have phased-array radar, which can track threats and targets more quickly and accurately than previously displayed North Korean capabilities.
     
            Despite those indications of advanced warfighting abilities, analysts urged caution in making assumptions.
     
            Almost any shipbuilder can get the hull and propulsion systems right, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and Hawaii-based analyst.
     
            “However, modern warships represent an integration challenge of communications, electronics, weapons, and both electronic and acoustic sensor technologies” that is not so easily achieved, he said.
     
            In an interview with CNN in March, South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee, a member of the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee, questioned whether Pyongyang has the technical ability to build an advanced warship, or the infrastructure to support it.
     
            “Operating such a big military warship takes significant amount of budget. They not only have to build a warship, but make a team that would operate it, and it costs to operate it including the equipment and fuel. Also, one huge warship cannot go out on its own. So the question is, can North Korea afford the cost?” he said.
     
            Kim, the retired South Korean admiral, was cautious on not underestimating what the final product may look like, especially its lethality.
     
            “If North Korea equips the new frigate with the hypersonic ballistic missile it claimed to have successfully tested in January, that will cause a game changing impact in the regional security,” the former naval officer said.
     
            After reviewing the satellite images for CNN, Schuster said it’s likely a year or more of work remains before the new North Korean warship can begin sea trials.
     
            “This ship’s construction is being delayed by the lack of the superstructure, sensor and weapons systems intended for installation,” he said.
     
            North Korea’s navy has about 400 patrol combatants and 70 submarines, according to the most recent estimate from the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in a 2021 report.
     
            Though that’s a large number of vessels, most of them are old and small.
     
            Joseph Dempsey, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote in a January blog post that Pyongyang has only two principal surface combatants. Those Najin-class frigates – 1,600-ton warships dating to the early 1970s – are obsolete, he wrote.
     
            The DIA report said the North Korean navy would largely be reduced to coastal defense in any conflict with South Korea or the United States, both of which have vastly superior naval forces.
     
            But North Korean leader Kim has been pushing to modernize his naval fleet. It is also developing submarine-launched missiles and the subs to carry them.
     
            In September, Kim inspected the site for a new naval port.
     
            “Now that we are soon to possess large surface warships and submarines which cannot be anchored at the existing facilities for mooring warships, the construction of a naval base for running the latest large warships has become a pressing task,” he said at the time.
     
            Yu Yong-won, a South Korean lawmaker, said the ship under construction at the Nampo yard is only one example of Kim trying to modernize his navy.
     
            A nuclear-powered submarine is under construction at a shipyard in the North Korean port of Sinpo and another frigate or destroyer is in the works in Chongjin, Yu said.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/05/sport/china-zhao-xintong-snooker-champion-intl-hnk-spt,"Zhao Xintong becomes China’s first world snooker champion after comeback from ban | CNN
Follow: 
            Zhao Xintong became the first Chinese player to win the World Snooker Championship with a victory over Welshman and three-times winner Mark Williams at the Crucible Theatre on Monday, the latest chapter in Zhao’s remarkable rise and fall story.
     
            The 28-year-old won by 18 frames to 12 to become the first amateur to win the world title, despite a spirited comeback attempt from Williams.
     
            “I can’t believe what I’ve done. It’s very exciting,” said Zhao, draped in a Chinese flag. “I was so nervous tonight. Mark is still a top player and put me under so much pressure. He’s the best.
     
            “It’s a very special moment for me, for Chinese snooker, for everyone.”
     
            Zhao received a 20-month ban in January 2023 after a match-fixing scandal that rocked the sport, the repercussions of which meant he was classed as an amateur at this event and needed to get through four rounds of qualifying to reach the Crucible – a grueling run to the title that began on April 7.
     
            The Chinese player, who lives just a 10-minute walk from the Crucible venue, took an 11-6 overnight lead into Monday’s third session.
     
            While Zhao looked completely unflappable and kept smiling throughout the afternoon session, Williams struggled for accuracy and appeared powerless to stop his opponent from taking a seemingly unassailable 17-8 lead, meaning Zhao needed to win just one frame in the evening final to claim the world title.
     
            But a free-wheeling Williams made things interesting by winning the evening’s first four frames with a flurry of excellent shots before the younger player answered in the fifth to secure victory.
     
            The final was already historic no matter the result, as the 50-year-old Williams became the oldest player to reach the final with his semi-final win over world No. 1 Judd Trump.
     
            “It’s been a brilliant tournament for me,” said Williams, momentarily fighting back tears. “The support I’ve had for the past two weeks has been unbelievable.
     
            “But what a potter Zhao is. I’m glad I’ll be too old when he’s dominating the game. I’ve got nothing but admiration for what he’s done, coming through the qualifiers. He hasn’t played for two years, bashed everybody up. There’s a new superstar of the game.”
     
            Zhao had swept aside seven-time winner Ronnie O’Sullivan in the semi-finals to set up what was billed as the coronation of a new snooker king.
     
            The Chinese player, nicknamed “the Cyclone”, raced out to an early 7-1 advantage in the best-of-35-frame contest but Williams staged a mini revival in Sunday’s second session to keep alive his hopes of a fourth title.
     
            No player, however, had overcome such a large overnight deficit since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977.
     
            Zhao joined Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy as the only qualifiers to capture snooker’s most prestigious trophy.
     
            He banked a check for £500,000 pounds ($664,000) with Monday’s victory, while Williams won £200,000 ($265,000) and climbed to No. 3 in the world ranking.
     
            Williams has been struggling with vision problems and played without glasses or contact lenses while he awaits lens replacement surgery in June.
     
            “I’m still playing quite good stuff, even though my eyesight is a bit blurry,” Williams said.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/26/asia/india-family-friends-shattered-tourist-massacre-kashmir-intl-hnk,"Kashmir attack: Family and friends shattered and scarred by massacre reigniting India-Pakistan tensions | CNN
Follow: 
            One victim had recently returned home after decades working abroad to enjoy a retirement filled with travel and family time; another hoped the trip into the beauty of Indian-administered Kashmir would cheer the spirits of his semi-paralyzed wife.
     
            Both men were among 26 tourists shot dead by militants this week in a massacre that has ripped open old wounds between India and its neighbor Pakistan, tipping them a step closer to military escalation.
     
            Both countries claim Kashmir in its entirety, but each control only part. They have fought three wars over the territory – which is famous for its dramatic mountains and lush meadows – since their independence from Britain in 1947.
     
            A bloody, decades-long insurgency in India’s part of the region has killed tens of thousands, waged by militant groups demanding either independence or a merger with Pakistan.
     
            India says those groups are supported by Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.
     
            Tuesday’s attack – during which men were singled out and gunned down from close range, according to survivors’ testimony – was the latest in a list of bloody incidents to stain the region.
     
            Balachandran Menonparambil feels as though he’s lost his “right hand,” after his friend of six decades Ramachandran Narayanamenon was killed in the attack.
     
            Having spent decades working in Qatar, Narayanamenon “looked forward to a life of retirement,” according to his friend, who described him as “a happy man,” caring and reliable.
     
            “He was on a trip with his wife Shiela, daughter Aarti, and two grandchildren and was looking forward to enjoying himself with his grandchildren,” said the 70-year-old.
     
            He recalled how “excited” Narayanamenon, 69, sounded in their last call before he boarded the flight to Kashmir on Monday.
     
            A day later, Menonparambil was told that his friend was dead.
     
            “I was watching TV and they began to show what was happening in Kashmir… so I called him, but he did not pick up,” he said.
     
            He then reached out to Narayanamenon’s son Arvind, who told him that “Dad is gone.”
     
            He said people came up to offer condolences to him at the cremation. “Everybody was asking me what I will do, only half of me is working now. I told them he is there with me in my heart,” he said.
     
            Other survivors speaking to local media said the gunmen accused some of the victims of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
     
            In 2019, Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government stripped Muslim-majority Kashmir of its previous autonomy, sparking protests.
     
            After Tuesday’s massacre, New Delhi swiftly pointed the finger at Pakistan, downgrading ties and suspending its participation in a crucial water-sharing treaty. Pakistan has denied involvement and said any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to it would be considered an act of war.
     
            As tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals escalate, India’s navy on Sunday said it carried out test missile strikes in a show of strength.
     
            Kavita Lele lost her husband Sanjay, 50, and two cousins – Hemant Joshi, 45, and Atul Mone, 43 – in the attack, her brother-in-law Rajesh Kadam told CNN.
     
            All three men, described as “loving fathers” and family breadwinners, came from just outside the megacity of Mumbai. They had taken the trip to Pahalgam together, according to Kadam.
     
            Sanjay and Hemant were both accountants working for small private firms, while Atul worked for the Indian Railways, he said.
     
            For the Leles, Kadam said, the trip was long planned. His sister-in-law suffers from a form of paralysis on the left side of her body that means she walks with difficulty.

            “They had been planning this trip for a while but because of her health issues… it had gotten postponed. Once her health was doing better, they finally all lined up their schedules and managed to go,” he said.
     
            “Lele told his wife that if you won’t go, none of us will go. So she agreed and finally they all went,” said Kadam.
     
            Kadam himself did not go on the trip, but later traveled to Kashmir to help bring the shell-shocked survivors from his family back home.
     
            The holidaying family bought food from a stall not long before the attack. Unaccustomed to the realities of the restive region, they initially mistook the sound of gunfire for fireworks, Kadam said, but were warned to take shelter by locals who sensed danger.
     
            All three men were shot shortly after, he said. A bullet grazed his 20-year-old nephew Harshal’s hand.
     
            It took almost four hours for disabled Kavita to struggle down the hill to safety, he said.
     
            He said the families have taken hope from protests in India demanding justice for the victims and their families.
     
            Still, their lives have been changed forever.
     
            “This is not something that can end,” he said.
     
            “We have to now live with this.”

Follow: 
            A﻿ ship that US and Philippine forces planned to sink beat them to it.
     
            A former US World War II-era warship, which survived two of the Pacific War’s most important battles, was supposed to go down in a blaze of glory in a live-fire exercise off the western coast of the Philippines as part of annually held joint military drills.
     
            Instead, before the bombs and missiles could fly, it slipped slowly beneath the South China Sea Monday morning, age and the ocean catching up to it before modern weaponry could decimate it.
     
            The ex-USS Brattleboro was to be the main target for the maritime strike (MARSTRIKE) portion of the annual US-Philippine “Balikatan” exercise, which began April 21 and runs to May 9.
     
            “The vessel was selected because it exceeded its service life and was no longer suitable for normal operations,” according to a statement from the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

            A US Navy spokesperson told USNI News last month that the﻿ 81-year-old ship was to be the target for US Marine Corps F/A-18 fighter jets during the exercise. A report from the official Philippine News Agency (PNA) said it was to be hit by US and Philippine forces with a combination of anti-ship missiles, bombs and automatic cannon fire.
     
            But as the 184-foot-long vessel was being towed to its station for the exercise, 35 miles west of Zambales province on the northern Philippine island of Luzon, it took on water, the Philippine military statement said.
     
            “Due to rough sea conditions that we are currently experiencing in the exercise box and with its long service life, as is expected, she took on a significant amount of water and eventually sank,” Philippine Navy spokesperson Capt. John Percie Alcos said, according to PNA. He said the vessel was not damaged while being towed.
     
            The ship sank quietly at 7:20 a.m. local time near the spot where it was to be obliterated later in the day, according to the Philippine military.  
 
            Other elements of the MARSTRKE exercise would go on, the military statement said.
     
            The Philippine and US joint task forces “will rehearse virtual and constructive fire missions,” the statement said, without detailing what elements were still scheduled as part of the drill. “The combined force will still achieve its training objectives,” it added.
     
            The Philippine military said there was no environmental danger from the sinking as the vessel had been cleaned before being towed out for the exercise.
     
            The sinking of the ex-USS Brattleboro was a quiet end for a ship that distinguished itself across decades.
     
            In World War II, it participated in the battles of Leyte Gulf and Okinawa, two key US defeats of Imperial Japanese forces in 1944 and 1945 respectively.
     
            The ship, designated as a submarine chaser, served in a key rescue and air defense role in the Battle of Leyte during the US invasion of the Philippines, according to the US Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC).

            Over the course of a month, it helped get more than 400 wounded soldiers from shore to larger hospital ships and shot down a Japanese aircraft, according to the NHHC.
     
            After further combat around the island of Palau and later again in the Philippines, Brattleboro got orders to head to Okinawa to support the US invasion there in the spring of 1945.
     
            The invasion of Okinawa commenced on April 1, and “over the next 91 days, the subchaser treated over 200 badly wounded men and rescued in excess of 1,000 survivors of ships that sank,” the NHC history says.
     
            After being retired from US service in the mid-1960s, the ship was transferred to the South Vietnamese military in 1966.
     
            With the fall of Saigon in 1975, the then-South Vietnamese ship was transferred to the Philippines, where it was recommissioned as the Miguel Malvar – a hero of the Philippine revolution – in the Philippine Navy in 1977.
     
            It was decommissioned in 2021.
     
            Monday’s ship-sinking exercise was planned in an offshore area facing the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal, which has been closely guarded by the Chinese coast guard, navy and suspected militia ships, according to the Associated Press. The Philippines also claims the fishing atoll, which lies about 137 miles west of Zambales.
     
            This year’s Balikatan, called “shoulder-to-shoulder” in Tagalag, involves more than 14,000 Filipino and US troops in exercises designed to be a “full battle test” between the two defense treaty allies in response to regional security concerns.
     
            China and the Philippines have faced increasing clashes in the waters near Scarborough Shoal in recent years, as China exerts its disputed sovereignty over the entirety of the vast South China Sea. And tensions between Beijing and Manila are their worst in years amid concerns of military conflict.
     
            China has vehemently opposed such exercises involving US forces in or near the South China Sea.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/26/europe/russia-regains-kursk-claim-intl,"Russia claims recapture of Kursk border region but Ukraine says fighting continues | CNN
Follow: 
            Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed his country’s forces have recaptured Kursk, the border region where Ukraine launched a surprise offensive last year, though Kyiv insists its troops are fiercely battling to preserve their foothold in the territory.
     
            “The Kyiv regime’s adventure has completely failed,” Putin said Saturday, congratulating the Russian forces that he said defeated the Ukrainian military in the region. If confirmed, the capture would be a symbolic boost for the Kremlin at a crucial point in the war, with the US expressing growing impatience with the Russian leader for stalling on peace talks.
     
            Senior Ukrainian military officials have disputed Putin’s claims, warning Moscow had not yet regained control of those battlegrounds – and that Kyiv’s soldiers maintained a heavy presence in the region.
     
            “Russia has not yet liberated the Kursk region by 100%,” Oleh Shyriaiev, an army commander, said in a voice message on Sunday. He told CNN that Russian forces “are pressing” and “trying to counter-attack.”
     
            “We are working, fighting,” he added. “These are not territorial successes… But successes in destroying enemy armoured vehicles and personnel.”
     
            By midday on Sunday, Russia launched almost 70 attacks on Ukrainian positions, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing the country’s commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.
     
            CNN is unable to independently verify battlefield reports but both sides have been struggling to make gains elsewhere on the frontlines.
     
            Shyriaiev’s 225th regiment was among the first units to have entered Kursk in August – when Ukraine launched its shock incursion, swiftly capturing territory in what was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II.
     
            Since then, Russia, with support from North Korean soldiers, has been fighting to oust Ukraine’s forces from its borders, while Kyiv had poured precious resources into holding onto its territory there, with the view of using it as a key bargaining chip in any peace talks. The operation was also launched to relieve pressure from the embattled eastern frontline.
     
            In his address, Putin said recapturing Kursk “creates conditions for further successful actions of our troops in other important areas of the front.”
     
            In a post on Telegram, Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, thanked the North Korean soldiers, praising their “high professionalism, steadfastness, courage and heroism in battle.”
     
            Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports found that about 12,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to fight in Russia.
     
            Local authorities are working to restore “peaceful life” in Kursk, Gerasimov said, as the region is demined and unexploded ordnance is destroyed. Forest areas, basements and abandoned buildings are being checked for any remaining Ukrainian soldiers, he added.
     
            Zelensky reiterated calls for a “full and unconditional” ceasefire after a series of war talks held among Ukrainian, US and Russian leaders in recent days – as tensions between the three countries thwarted efforts to achieve an agreement.
     
            “Ukraine continues to defend its independence and its land in battles,” Zelensky said on Sunday, following a briefing with a senior military aide about the battleground in Kursk.
     
            “The situation on the frontline and the real activity of the Russian army prove that the current global pressure on Russia is insufficient to bring this war to an end,” he added.
     
            If Putin’s claims are true, hopes of using Kursk as a bargaining counter are now gone. Ukraine’s retreat also has the potential to dent Kyiv’s political clout as well as its military’s morale after three years of war, with intense efforts underway towards finding peace.
     
            The coming week will be “very critical”  in determining whether the US can attempt to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, according to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio – suggesting President Donald Trump’s deadline for reaching a deal was swiftly approaching.
     
            “This week is going to be a really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in, or if it’s time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally, if not more, important,” Rubio said on NBC.
     
            “There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic,” he added. “We’re close, but we’re not close enough.”

            Rubio’s tempered remarks followed a whirlwind week of diplomacy that saw Trump accuse Zelensky of making it “so difficult to settle this war” for refusing to accept Russia’s annexation of Crimea but later saying Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal.”
     
            On Saturday morning, at the funeral of the late Pope Francis in the Vatican, Zelensky briefly met with Trump for talks on potential peace negotiations. A White House spokesperson called the meeting “productive,” while Zelensky thanked Trump for the meeting, writing on X that it “has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.”
     
            A few hours later on Saturday afternoon, Trump raised the prospect of applying new sanctions on Russia for launching a deadly wave of attacks on Kyiv last week.
     
            “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.
     
            “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’ Too many people are dying!!!”

Follow: 
            A four-year-old girl and a man have been killed after a driver crashed an SUV into the entrance of Manila International Airport on Sunday, the Philippine Red Cross said.
     
            The driver crashed the car through the outer railing and onto a walkway where people were standing outside the departure area at Ninoy Aquino International Airport’s Terminal 1 just before 9 a.m., the Philippine Red Cross said in a statement.
     
            “The incident tragically resulted in the casualties of two individuals – a male adult and a 4-year-old girl,” it said.
     
            The driver is in police custody and individuals are being treated for injuries, the airport’s operator said in a statement, though it did not specify how many people were hurt.
     
            There is currently no indication from police that the crash was deliberate.
     
            CNN has reached out to police in Pasay City, the area of the Philippine capital where the airport is located, for comment.
     
            The Philippine Red Cross said it deployed 18 volunteers and five ambulances to respond to the crash, including a rescue vehicle for “potential extrication operations,” according to the statement.
     
            Videos shared on social media by the news agency of the Philippine government showed chaos at the airport, and a black SUV crashed into the entryway of the terminal. People could be heard screaming and crying in the video, which appeared to show several people injured on the ground and baggage strewn about, as first responders attended to the scene.
     
            “At this time, we are awaiting official confirmation on the cause of the incident and reports of injuries,” the statement from the airport’s operator said.
     
            “We understand the concern this incident has caused, especially as images have circulated on social media,” said the statement.
     
            “We urge the public not to speculate and to wait for verified updates, which will be issued as soon as they become available.”

            Last week, President Donald Trump advised Americans that his trade war could result in children’s dolls costing “a couple bucks more.” That, at least, seems to have come to fruition.
     
            Mattel, the toy manufacturing giant and maker of Barbie, plans to raise prices on American toys due to tariffs, it said Monday in its earnings report.
     
            Mattel said that tariffs hadn’t affected its earnings for the first three months of the year. To mitigate future losses, it plans to diversify its supply chain outside of China and “where necessary, taking pricing action in its US business.”
     
            That’s Wall Street speak for higher prices.
     
            A prolonged trade war means that for many American families, an extensive Barbie or Polly Pocket collection could soon be a luxury. Trump’s 145% tariffs on most goods coming from China are slamming the toy industry. Nearly 80% of all toys sold in the United States are manufactured in China, according to industry group the Toy Association. Mattel CFO Anthony DiSilvestro said during its earnings call on Monday that the current tariffs would cost it roughly $270 million this year and “that’s before you consider any of the mitigating action.”
     
            There’s already evidence some prices are on the rise. According to a product pricing analysis from Telsey Advisory Group, a Barbie doll with swimsuit sold at Target rose 42.9% over a week in mid-April to $14.99. That’s among the largest jumps the consumer research firm tracked.
     
            Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz told investors Monday that “under the current scenarios we are considering” in response to tariffs, he expects 40% to 50% of its products to remain priced at $20 or less. However, he also advocated for zero tariffs on toys and games around the world.
     
            “Zero tariffs for toys gives the greatest number of children and families access to play,” he said.
     
            Mattel sources products from seven different countries, Kreiz said in February. He expects China to represent less than 40% of global production for its toys in 2025, half the number of the industry average. He also plans to slash US imports from China to less than 15% in 2026 and less than 10% by 2027. On Monday, Kreiz said it will be relocating production of 500 toys from China to other countries.
     
            Mattel also joins the laundry list of companies that has paused their full-year 2025 guidance because it said it’s hard to predict consumer spending, particularly in the lucrative holiday season. It’s a big deal when companies pull their guidance, experts previously told CNN, because it raises significant uncertainty — something investors and analysts all run away from.

President asks for ‘patience’ as businesses react negatively to Trump’s aggressive efforts to upend global trade. United States President Donald Trump blames former president Joe Biden for the decline of key economic indicators during his first months as president, amid widespread disruptions caused by Trump’s tariff policies. The US economy contracted by 0.3 percent during the first quarter of the year, the first such drop in three years. During the last three months of 2024, the economy grew by 2.4 percent. “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” Trump said in a post on his website Truth Social. “Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang.’ This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!”      Since taking office, Trump’s efforts to upend the global trade system through a series of aggressive import duties have caused turmoil in financial markets amid fears of an escalating trade war and uncertainty surrounding the tariff policies. The first quarter saw an uptick in imports, as US businesses seek to get out ahead of higher costs that could accompany future tariffs. Inflation, however, continues to ease. In March, consumer prices were 2.3 percent higher than they were a year earlier, compared with 2.5 percent in February. In a press release from the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt mirrored Trump’s claims that Biden was to blame for any turbulence while also stating that the Wednesday economic report showed “strong economic momentum”. “It’s no surprise the leftovers of Biden’s economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth, but the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,” Leavitt said. Many economic analysts blame Trump’s chaotic approach to tariffs for the US’s flagging indicators. Since taking office, the S&P 500 has shrunk by about 7.3 percent.      “If the blowout on trade was the result of firms pre-buying imported inputs to beat the tariffs, the decay in the trade balance will reverse in second quarter,” Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told the news agency Reuters. “That will generate some GDP growth. However, corrosive uncertainty and higher taxes, tariffs are a tax on imports, will drag GDP growth back into the red by the end of this year.” In recent weeks, the White House has suggested that it could draw down tariffs with key US trading partners such as China, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stating last week that current rates were not “sustainable”.

 Step inside a typical home in the United States, and you will quickly find that much of what fills it, from the fruit and vegetables in the kitchen to the bicycle in the garage, is produced elsewhere. As President Donald Trump pushes forward with his tariffs policy to bring manufacturing back to the US, steep import taxes will drive up prices for consumers, affecting everything from clothing to appliances as businesses adjust to the new cost structure. So, how much of each room in the house relies on imports, and what would it look like without those foreign-made products? Join us on a journey through a house, where we explore the impact that global trade has on everyday life. Starting in the kitchen, we see a mix of US-made and foreign-made products. Here's a breakdown of where some of the most common foods and drinks are sourced from:  While the large majority of apples (95 percent) and oranges (80 percent) are grown domestically, especially in the states of Washington, California and Florida, tropical fruits like bananas (1 percent domestically grown), pineapples (10 percent), and avocados (10 percent) are primarily imported from countries like Ecuador, Costa Rica and Mexico. Similarly, the majority of common vegetables, including corn (99 percent), potatoes (95 percent), pumpkins (95 percent) and beans (80 percent), are predominantly produced in the US, particularly in states like Iowa, Idaho, Illinois and Nebraska. These states are renowned for their extensive agricultural output, with Iowa and Illinois leading in corn and soya bean production, and Idaho excelling in potatoes. In contrast, only one-third of the tomatoes consumed in the US are domestically produced, with the majority coming from Mexico. Staple items such as rice (80-90 percent), wheat (90 percent) and sugar (70 percent) are largely produced in the US, though some rice and speciality grains are imported. Meats, especially beef (90 percent) and poultry (95 percent), are predominantly US-raised, especially in the states of Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, Georgia and Arkansas, which are known for their large-scale livestock farming operations. Eggs (95 percent) and cheese (95 percent) are also mostly produced in the US. Seafood production in the US is a mix of wild-caught and farmed, with at least two-thirds of the seafood consumed being imported from countries like China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Canada. Only about 1 percent of the tea and coffee consumed in the US is domestically produced, as the climate is not suitable for large-scale cultivation. Coffee is primarily imported from Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam and Ethiopia, while tea comes from China, India, Sri Lanka and Kenya. The vast majority of soda (90 percent) is produced domestically. Companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper dominate the US market, with numerous manufacturing facilities nationwide. Moving on to the living room, most items, especially consumer electronics and home appliances, are imported.  The proportion of furniture in US homes that is domestically produced has been steadily declining, with most furniture now being imported. About one-third of furniture sold in the US is domestically produced, while the remaining two-thirds are imported. The largest exporters of furniture to the US include China, Vietnam, Mexico and Italy. Almost all televisions sold in the US are produced outside of the country, with a very small portion (about 1 percent) assembled domestically. The vast majority of TVs are manufactured overseas, primarily in China, South Korea and Vietnam. A significant number of TVs sold in the US are assembled in Mexico, where several leading TV brands have assembly plants. Less than 1 percent of phones sold in the US are manufactured domestically. Manufacturing mobile phones requires a highly specialised workforce and extensive infrastructure, including advanced supply chains for components like screens, processors and batteries. The production process is highly globalised, with parts sourced from different countries. The US market for light bulbs is heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China. According to IBISWorld, a market research firm, the number of lighting and bulb manufacturing businesses in the US has declined by 1.5 percent per year on average over the five years between 2019 and 2024. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), nearly 90 percent of homes use air-conditioning. The US has a robust domestic air-conditioning industry, with companies like Trane, Carrier, Lennox and Rheem operating large-scale manufacturing facilities across the country. However, while many air-conditioning units are assembled in the US, the majority rely on components sourced from abroad. Key parts such as compressors, circuit boards and refrigerant systems are often imported from China, Mexico and South Korea. In the bedroom, much like the living room, most everyday items, including clothing, toys and personal care products, are imported.  The vast majority of mattresses (90 percent) bought in the US are made domestically, according to statistics compiled by the International Sleep Products Association. Two US megacorporations - Tempur Sealy International, with its headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky, and Serta Simmons Holdings, based in Atlanta, Georgia - together account for nearly half of mattress sales in the entire industry. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of fabric goods, including blankets, sold in the US are made domestically. The overwhelming majority are imported, mainly from countries with significant textile industries, like China, India and Bangladesh. The US apparel market is one of the largest globally, with consumers spending billions of dollars on clothing each year. While the US once had a robust clothing manufacturing industry, much of production shifted overseas by the late 20th century to countries with lower labour costs. Today, only about 2-3 percent of clothing and only 1 percent of shoes sold in the US are made domestically. The majority of these items are imported from China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India, which are top players in textile and garment production. Less than 1 percent of toys sold in the US are manufactured domestically. The vast majority, some 75 percent, are imported from China, with additional imports from countries like Vietnam, India and Indonesia. Less than 10 percent of beauty and personal care products sold in the US are made domestically, according to NielsenIQ data. This includes categories like hair care, cosmetics, nail products, as well as bath and shower products. The vast majority of these items are imported, primarily from manufacturing hubs such as China, South Korea, France and Italy. Moving along to the garage, again, practically everything is mostly not made in the US.  In 2024, approximately 16 million new vehicles were sold across the US. Of those, about 45 percent were from US car companies, including top manufacturers like Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep. The most popular vehicle sold in the US is the Ford F-Series pick-up truck, which has maintained its position as the top-selling vehicle in the US for more than four decades. However, while these companies might have their headquarters in the US, they all outsource auto parts manufacturing or assembly to countries with lower production costs, such as Mexico, China, South Korea and Canada. The vast majority (97 percent) of bicycles sold in the US are imported, with most coming from China, Taiwan, Vietnam and Cambodia. Some 30 to 40 percent of lawn mowers sold in the US are produced domestically, with leading brands like John Deere and Toro manufacturing a portion of their products in the US. However, the remaining 60 to 70 percent of lawn mowers are imported, primarily from China, Taiwan and Vietnam. Approximately 60 percent of fishing gear - including rods, reels and tackle boxes - sold in the US is imported, with about two-thirds of these imports coming from China, according to the American Sportfishing Association. The US is a significant importer of domestic cooking appliances, with barbecue grills alone accounting for at least $3.35bn in market value in 2024. A large share of grills sold in the US are imported, mainly from China, Vietnam and South Korea. Several well-known brands, including Weber, Char-Broil and Traeger, have moved a significant portion of their manufacturing operations overseas, with much of it now based in China. The reality of global trade is complex, and understanding the interconnectedness in supply chains is crucial in navigating the future of US manufacturing.

Australians will decide if they will give Labor another term in office as both local and global issues weigh on their minds. Australians are heading to the polls shortly in parliamentary elections which will decide if Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s centre-left Labor government will return for a second term. Labor’s main rival is the country’s conservative coalition, led by opposition leader Peter Dutton, which came into the election campaign polling strongly but is now lagging slightly behind Labor. If Albanese does win, it could mean Australia is following in similar footsteps to Canada, where the Liberal party reversed its prospects in recent weeks, amid concerns about the effect of United States President Donald Trump’s policies on Canada’s economy. Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute, an independent research centre, told Al Jazeera that polls indicate President Trump is “an increasing concern for Australian voters” and that “Labor’s gamble of holding a later election to allow some of Trump’s policies to start to impact has paid off.” In comparison with Canada, where both major parties tried to distance themselves from Trump, Remeikis notes that Australia’s opposition leader Dutton has courted “favourable comparisons” to Trump for months. But, he has been “badly damaged by the ‘Temu Trump’ label” – a reference to the Chinese online shopping website known for selling cheap copies of original brands. War on Gaza and the price of eggs Uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs on Australia has only compounded the concerns of many Australians around the cost of essential items, including housing, food, healthcare and childcare. In the final televised leaders’ debate, a week before the election, both Dutton and Albanese stumbled when asked to guess how much a dozen eggs might cost at a supermarket. Albanese was closer, guessing 7 Australian dollars, nearly two dollars less than the actual price of $8.80, while Dutton guessed $4.20, less than half the actual price. Cost of living has “trumped everything” leading into the election, says Josie Hess, who comes from the Latrobe Valley, a coal-mining region in Victoria, and who also works for advocacy group Environment Victoria. For a number of Australians, the most important issue on election day will be beyond Australia’s borders, says Nasser Mashni, the president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN). Mashni told Al Jazeera that “the genocide that is occurring in Palestine” has seen a “new constituency” emerge in Australia that understands that Israel is “a settler colonialist movement doing exactly what occurred here [in Australia] 238 years ago”. APAN has developed a scorecard of where the major parties stand on Palestine. Of those, only the Greens received a tick from APAN on every issue. The scorecard for Labor was mixed, while the conservative Liberal-National coalition did not meet a single criterion. “We’ve asked for people to make Palestine their number one issue and to find a candidate that best reflects a just and humane position for Palestine,” Mashni said. “Certainly, the easiest candidates to find will be in the Senate, but I am sure there’ll be somebody in every seat where they can vote a little bit better for Palestine, and in some cases, very well for Palestine,” he added.      Dozens of minor parties and independents from across the political spectrum are also vying for votes. Remeikis said there is a “late surge to the nationalistic, far-right, One Nation party”, which has been aided by Dutton’s conservative coalition preferencing votes for One Nation, and vice versa, in outer suburban and inner regional seats. Next year marks 30 years since One Nation’s leader Pauline Hanson was first elected to federal office in Australia. But Remeikis says the late surge is unlikely to affect the outcome of the election, with polls suggesting Labor will win with a minority government. The Greens, along with some independents running on pro-climate action platforms, will also be hoping to repeat successes in Australia’s 2022 election, which followed many months of devastating fires and floods. With climate change remaining a key concern for many Australians, Dutton, whose party has long delayed taking action on climate, has chosen to focus on campaigning to build Australia’s first-ever nuclear power stations in areas where coal power stations are closing down, such as the Latrobe Valley, in Victoria. This week, organisations representing more than 350,000 emergency and health services workers released a letter calling on Dutton to drop his plan to introduce nuclear energy to Australia, saying “Australia’s current emergency services do not have the support or resources to respond to nuclear disasters.” Josie Hess, a Latrobe Valley local who works for Environment Victoria, told Al Jazeera that people there still have questions about the viability of Dutton’s proposal.      She says people in the valley “desperately need jobs” but the timeline to build nuclear means that it would do little to help workers now. “We have some people who support nuclear but for the most part, the Latrobe Valley is not a monolith, and there is clear and demonstrable opposition to the proposal,” she said. And while economic issues are a concern, she added, there is also an “intrinsic link between climate security and cost of living and housing”. Melissa Sweet, who runs public health news site Croakey, told Al Jazeera that climate change remains a key issue for Australian health workers heading into the election. “Heatwaves, floods, and bushfires are already driving up demand for emergency care, mental health services, and chronic disease management,” Sweet said. The recent US cuts to “public health, global health and climate action and science generally” under Trump mean it’s “more important than ever” that the next Australian government invests in these areas, Sweet added.

Australian prime minister says he discussed tariffs and AUKUS security partnership in call with US president. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said he had a “warm” conversation with United States President Donald Trump about trade and other issues after his Labor Party’s decisive election win over the weekend. Speaking to the media in Canberra on Monday, Albanese said the two leaders discussed tariffs and the AUKUS nuclear submarine partnership in a congratulatory phone call made by the US president. “It was a very warm discussion about the friendship between our two nations that’s so important,” Albanese said. “I have had three conversations with the president. I won’t go into all the personal comments that he made, but it was very generous in his personal warmth and praise toward myself. He was fully aware of the outcome, and he expressed the desire to continue to work with me in the future.” Albanese made the comments after securing a thumping win in Saturday’s federal election, which was dominated by cost-of-living concerns and the spectre of Trump’s trade war. Albanese’s centre-left Labor far outperformed expectations after running behind the Liberal Party-National Party Coalition, led by former police officer Peter Dutton, for much of the year, taking at least 85 seats in the 151-member House of Representatives. Dutton, whom critics accused of channelling Trump’s populist style, and his Coalition suffered an electoral wipeout, with partial results showing it ahead in just 40 seats. Australia, one of the closest US allies, has been slapped with a 10 percent tariff as part of Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” duties on dozens of trade partners. While Trump has paused most of his double-digit tariffs until July, his administration has been collecting a baseline tariff of 10 percent on almost all imports since early April. Albanese at the time slammed Trump’s tariff as “unwarranted”, saying the move was “not the act of a friend”.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",0.9755,0.113,0.847,0.04

Ministry of Commerce says ‘door is open’ to talks, but it is willing to ‘fight to the end’ otherwise. China has said it is considering proposals by the United States to begin negotiations on US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The US has “recently, through relevant channels, actively conveyed messages to China, expressing a desire to engage in talks”, China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Friday. “China is currently evaluating this.” Beijing’s remarks come after Chinese state media reported earlier in the week that the Trump administration had “proactively reached out” through multiple channels. Trump’s trade war with China has resulted in a de facto mutual trade embargo between the world’s two largest economies. Businesses and investors have been anxiously waiting for signs that Washington and Beijing will ease their steep tariffs on each other’s goods amid fears that a protracted standoff will inflict serious damage on the global economy. The International Monetary Fund last month lowered its global growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8 percent, down from 3.3 percent in January, while JPMorgan Chase has put the likelihood of a US recession this year at 60 percent. Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial services company in Beijing, said that China appears to be sincere about being open to talks provided the US is serious. “Again, they’ve got a lot of tools: The tariffs are already in place, but they also have export controls and can launch more probes into US companies,” Beddor told Al Jazeera. “The list goes on. Most importantly, they’re ready to stimulate to blunt the damage to economic growth. But policymakers also clearly understand that it would be a lot better if they didn’t have to use those tools because there was a de-escalation.” Trump, who has slapped a 145 percent tariff on Chinese exports, has repeatedly insisted that his administration is in negotiations with Beijing, a claim that Chinese officials have rejected as “groundless”. On Wednesday, Trump said there was a “very good chance” he would reach a trade deal with China, so long as it was “fair”. In its statement on Friday, China’s Commerce Ministry said that its stance on the trade dispute had been consistent. “If there is a fight, we will fight to the end; if there are talks, the door is open,” the ministry said. “The tariff war and trade war were unilaterally initiated by the US, and if the US wants to talk, it should demonstrate sincerity by preparing to correct its erroneous actions and rescind the unilateral imposition of additional tariffs,” it said, adding that “attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and blackmail” would not work with China. In an interview with Fox News that aired on Thursday night, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Trump’s tariffs were badly hurting the Chinese economy and Beijing was eager to talk. “The Chinese are reaching out, they want to meet, they want to talk,” Rubio told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “We’ve got people involved in that.” Rubio also said that the tensions were a “wake-up call” for the US, and the country should not be as dependent on China. “Two more years in this direction, and we are going to be in a lot of trouble, really dependent on China,” he said. “So, I do think there is this broader question about how much we should buy from them at all.” Steven Okun, the CEO of Singapore-based consultancy APAC Advisors, said it would not be a surprise to see meetings between Chinese and US officials “given the interdependence of their economies and the damage being done to both”, but characterising such contact as a “negotiation” would be premature.

Noting string of fatal incidents, President Xi Jinping calls for stronger safety measures for tourism and public events. A sudden storm in southwestern China’s Guizhou province has capsized four boats, killing 10 people and injuring 70. More than 80 people fell into the water, state media reported on Monday, when the rain and hailstorm struck the vessels on a stretch of the Wu River near Qianxi City on Sunday afternoon. Rescue operations ran overnight. Initial reports said nine people had died, with one person missing. However, rescue personnel discovered the missing person, who “showed no signs of life”, around noon, state broadcaster CCTV reported. In one video shared by state media, a man could be seen performing CPR on a person, while one of the vessels drifted upside-down. Initial reports suggested two tourist vessels had capsized. However, CCTV later confirmed that four boats were involved – two of which were not carrying passengers at the time – in the incident, which occurred on the upper reaches of the waterway, which is a tributary of the Yangtze River, China’s longest. The seven crew members on board the two vessels, carrying no passengers, managed to swim to safety, the broadcaster said. A witness interviewed by the state-owned Beijing News said some passengers managed to swim to safety after the storm had descended rapidly, and thick mist obscured visibility on the river.      According to CCTV, the boats involved were not overloaded. Each had a maximum capacity of 40 passengers. Provincial authorities dispatched some 500 emergency personnel to lead the rescue operation. President Xi Jinping called for “all-out efforts” in the search and rescue operations and treatment of those injured, state news agency Xinhua said. Xi also “underscored the importance of strengthening safety measures in tourist attractions” and other large public venues, the agency said. He also noted a string of recent fatal incidents across the country. The Wu River, which winds through Guizhou’s mountainous interior, is a popular destination for domestic tourists, particularly during holidays. China’s May Day holiday, from May 1 to May 5, saw a sharp increase in domestic travel. Government data cited by state media showed that many tourist destinations across the country were overwhelmed by crowds.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",0.8905,0.11,0.811,0.079

Labor Party leader becomes the first Australian prime minister to win a second consecutive three-year term in two decades. Anthony Albanese has become the first Australian prime minister to win a second consecutive three-year term in two decades, in a dramatic comeback for his Labor Party in a general election dominated by the cost-of-living crisis. The Labor Party was on track on Saturday for an unexpectedly large parliamentary majority, as Peter Dutton, leader of the conservative Liberal Party, conceded defeat, having lost his own seat. In his victory speech, left-leaning Albanese pledged to steer the nation through a rough patch of global uncertainty. “Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,” he told supporters in Sydney. “We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people.” Australia’s public broadcaster ABC projected that Labor was on track to win 85 seats in the House of Representatives, easily surpassing the 76-seat threshold needed to reach a majority. Results in the Senate were still unclear. While Labor could pick up some seats, it may still need the support of minor parties, such as the Greens or independents, to pass legislation. During his victory speech, Albanese said the Australian people had voted for “Australian values”. “For fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all,” he said amid a loud cheer. “In this time of global uncertainty, Australians have chosen optimism and determination.” Meanwhile, Dutton of the main opposition Liberal Party accepted full responsibility for the poor election results on what he called a “historic occasion” for the party. Dutton also lost his own Dickson seat to Labor’s Ali France, a former journalist and disability advocate who has pushed for easing the cost of living through tax cuts, cheaper medicine, and investment in public healthcare and education. Senator James Paterson, a Liberal spokesperson, suggested “the Trump factor” was in play in Australia, in reference to United States President Donald Trump. Trump had cast a long shadow over the six-week election campaign, leading to keen global interest in whether his tariff-induced economic chaos would influence the result. The high cost of living, healthcare, housing prices and clean energy were also some of the top issues for Australian voters in the election. Reporting from Sydney, Al Jazeera’s Jessica Washington said it was a historic win for the Labor Party. “There was certainly a message of unity by the prime minister. There was also a short moment during his speech when the crowd began to boo Peter Dutton, and he immediately hushed them and said that wasn’t the Australian way,” she said. “Labor has pledged to make it easier for young people to buy homes and has also made promises, including a 20 percent cut to student debt,” Washington added. “This makes the loss doubly embarrassing for the opposition coalition because they are often seen as the economic managers, but they lost in an election held largely around those issues.” The election results extend the Labor Party’s return to power after nearly a decade in opposition. In the last election, in 2022, Labor secured a parliamentary majority, winning 77 seats out of 151 in the House of Representatives.               Follow Al Jazeera English:",0.985,0.118,0.836,0.046

From tariff turmoil to culling federal government agencies, what has Trump done in his first 100 days? United States President Donald Trump is marking his first 100 days back in office with a rally in Macomb County, Michigan, just north of Detroit, a city renowned for its automotive industry. In the space of just more than three months, he has signed more executive orders than any other president, sent markets spiralling with tariffs and for the most part stuck to his America First policy, except when it comes to Israel.     Al Jazeera looks at some of his biggest decisions in numbers: Trump has signed at least 142 executive orders so far, which, according to the American Presidency Project, is more than any other US president in their first 100 days in office. An executive order is a directive issued by the president to federal agencies that has the force of law but does not require congressional approval. On January 20, his first day in office, Trump signed 26 orders, which included pardoning more than 1,500 people convicted on January 6, 2021, Capitol riot charges; withdrawing from the World Health Organization; and renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The majority of Trump’s executive orders have focused on immigration and border security as well as energy and trade.  Since returning to office, Trump has pardoned more than 1,500 people, including his supporters convicted in connection with the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot after he lost the 2020 presidential election. Other notable pardons include Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road dark web marketplace, who was serving a sentence for drug trafficking and money laundering.  Tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was created by Trump through an executive order on January 20, in which he gave DOGE a mandate to slash government spending. According to figures published on DOGE’s website, the organisation is estimating that it has cut $160bn from the federal budget, representing about 8 percent of the $2 trillion Musk had initially pledged to save. DOGE said the biggest cuts have been made to the Department of Health and Human Services ($47.4bn), Agency for International Development ($45.2bn) and Department of State ($2.6bn). These figures have, however, been criticised for lacking sufficient evidence to back them up.  According to data collated by CNN, at least 121,000 workers have been fired from federal agencies with about 10,000 employees fired from the Agency for International Development (USAID), where 100 percent of the jobs were culled. USAID was the first agency Trump went after, and it has now been almost dissolved.      Trump’s administration has implemented a flurry of tariffs to, in his words, reduce the US trade deficit, remedy unfair trade policies against the US, bring manufacturing jobs back to the country and generate income for the US government. Starting on February 1, Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, including a 10 percent levy on Canadian energy, and hit Chinese goods with a 10 percent tariff. In the weeks that followed, Trump targeted steel and aluminium as well as auto imports with tariffs of 25 percent. By April, Trump had placed a baseline 10 percent tariff on goods imported from the rest of the world.    China received the highest tariff rate at 145 percent. However, some exemptions have been applied to technology-related items, such as smartphones. Canada and Mexico are facing tariffs of 25 percent on goods that are noncompliant with the trilateral USMCA trade deal they have with the US, affecting $63.8bn worth of trade, according to Bloomberg News. The European Union is facing what is for now a suspended 20 percent tariff rate. Since coming into office, Trump has sent shockwaves through the markets, largely due to his flip-flopping tariff announcements, which have caused uncertainty and volatility. Since the November election, despite an initial spike, all major indices have fallen: Since inauguration day, the markets have fallen even further:  In his first 100 days in office, Trump has hosted at least 11 world leaders. Unsurprisingly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was the first leader to arrive at the White House on February 4. It was during this visit that Trump said he would turn Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East”. World leaders who have visited Trump include: Since entering office, Trump has said he maintains an America First policy. On Ukraine, Trump has criticised the scale of US spending under former President Joe Biden, arguing that European countries should shoulder a greater share of the burden. On March 3, Trump ceased all military aid to Ukraine, a move that drew sharp criticism from European allies. The Trump administration has held several meetings with Ukrainian and Russian officials to try to end the fighting. In the Middle East, Trump has brandished proposals to take control of Gaza and redevelop it, an idea widely condemned for implying the ethnic cleansing of 2.3 million Palestinians. At the same time, his administration has continued sending US bombs to Israel, including 900kg (2,000lb) bombs, reinforcing unwavering US support for Israel. Since Trump’s inauguration on January 20, Israeli forces have killed at least 2,392 people in Gaza and 105 in the occupied West Bank. Additionally, about 3,000 people have either died from wounds sustained in Israeli attacks or were pulled dead from beneath the rubble. Elsewhere in the Middle East, the US has significantly increased its military actions in Yemen with attacks on Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Operation Rough Rider began on March 15, whose stated aim is stemming Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping. From March 15 to April 18, at least 207 US attacks were recorded in Yemen, resulting in at least 209 deaths, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).  During his 2024 election campaign, Trump made at least 75 promises, which included everything from mass deportations to releasing the 2021 Capitol Hill rioters. PolitiFact, an American nonprofit project operated by the Poynter Institute that fact-checks news statements, has been tracking Trump’s promises with its MAGA-Meter. According to its scorecard, Trump has kept six of his promises, broken one, stalled on four and is working on fulfilling 23. The remaining 41 promises have not yet been rated.

Allies of US President Donald Trump voice opposition to a bipartisan proposal that would expand a law that punishes boycotting Israel. Washington, DC – A bill in the United States Congress that aims to further penalise the boycotting of countries friendly to the US is facing opposition from allies of President Donald Trump over free speech concerns, putting its passage in jeopardy. According to Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vote in the House of Representatives on the proposal, previously scheduled for Monday, has been cancelled. Although Trump’s Republican Party has been leading legislative efforts to crack down on boycotts of Israel, over the past days, several conservatives close to the US president voiced opposition to the bill, dubbed the International Governmental Organization (IGO) Anti-Boycott Act. “It is my job to defend American’s [sic] rights to buy or boycott whomever they choose without the government harshly fining them or imprisoning them,” Greene said in a social media post on Monday. “But what I don’t understand is why we are voting on a bill on behalf of other countries and not the President’s executive orders that are FOR OUR COUNTRY???” Charlie Kirk, a prominent right-wing activist and commentator, also said that the bill should not pass. “In America you are allowed to hold differing views. You are allowed to disagree and protest,” Kirk wrote on X on Sunday. “We’ve allowed far too many people who hate America move here from abroad, but the right to speak freely is the birthright of all Americans.” Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and influential right-wing media personality, backed the comments of Kirk and Greene, writing on the social media platform Gettr, “Fact check: True” and “Agreed” in response to their statements, respectively.      The proposed legislation was introduced by pro-Israel hawks in the US Congress, Republican Mike Lawler and Democrat Josh Gottheimer, in January, and has been co-sponsored by 22 other lawmakers from both major parties. The bill would expand a 2018 law that bans coercive boycotts imposed by foreign governments to include international governmental organisations (IGOs). The original legislation prohibits boycotting a country friendly to the US based on an “agreement with, a requirement of, or a request from or on behalf” of another nation. It imposes penalties of up to $1m and 20 years in prison for violations. Expanding the legislation to include IGOs risks penalising individuals and companies in the US that boycott firms listed by the United Nations as doing business in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. While the bill itself does not explicitly mention Israel, its drafters have said that it targets the UN and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, which calls for economic pressure on the Israeli government to end its abuses against Palestinians. “This change targets harmful and inherently anti-Semitic BDS efforts at IGOs, such as the UN, by extending protections already in place for boycotts instigated by foreign countries,” Lawler’s office said in January. States and the federal government have been passing anti-BDS laws for years, raising the alarm about the violation of free speech rights, which are guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. Numerous legal cases have challenged these laws, and some judges have ruled that they are unconstitutional, while others have upheld them. Rights groups and Palestinian rights advocates have argued that anti-boycott laws aim to shut down the debate about Israel and criminalise peaceful resistance against its violations of international law.      Over the years, leading UN agencies and rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including imposing apartheid on Palestinians. But supporters of anti-BDS laws say the measures are designed to combat discrimination against Israel and regulate trade, not speech. Such laws have mainly faced opposition from progressive Democrats, but the IGO Anti-Boycott Act has generated anger from right-wing politicians, too. “Americans have the right to boycott, and penalizing this risks free speech. I reject and vehemently condemn antisemitism but I cannot violate the first amendment,” Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, wrote on X. I agree with @RepMTG .I’ll be voting No on this bill as well. https://t.co/YOPga59Xyc — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) May 4, 2025  The right-wing rejection of the Lawler-Gottheimer bill comes as the Trump administration continues with its push to target criticism of and protests against Israel, especially on college campuses. Since Trump took office, the US government has revoked the visas of hundreds of students for activism against Israel’s war on Gaza. Several students, including legal permanent residents, have been jailed over allegations of anti-Semitism and “spreading Hamas propaganda”. Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, has been detained since March, and the only known allegation against her is co-authoring an op-ed calling on her college to honour the student senate’s call for divesting from Israeli companies. Trump has also frozen and threatened to freeze federal funding for several universities, including Harvard, over pro-Palestine protests.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",-0.9965,0.078,0.776,0.146

Here are the issues dominating the federal elections and which party is leading in the polls. Australians will head to the polls on Saturday to vote in federal elections and choose their next parliament. The ruling centre-left Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, is polling slightly higher than the Liberal-National Coalition, led by Peter Dutton, in a campaign that has been largely dominated by housing price woes. Here is more about how the elections in Australia – where it has been compulsory to vote for the past century – will work: Australians will vote for the upper and lower houses of parliament. Voters will elect representatives for their area – members of parliament (MPs) – to the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, which initiates or proposes most laws. There are currently 151 elected members of the House, who hold their seats for three years. However, this year, the House will shrink to 150 elected members due to a redrawing of electoral districts. Voters will also elect representatives for their state or territory to the upper chamber of parliament, the Senate, which reviews the laws passed by the House. There are 76 elected senators who hold their seats for six years. This year, 40 of these seats are up for grabs. To form a government, a party needs to win a majority – at least 76 seats – in the House of Representatives. If no party wins an outright majority, the party with the highest number of seats forms a minority government by collaborating with smaller parties or independent members. Besides Labor and the Liberal-National Coalition, a number of independent and minor parties are also vying for seats.  More than 7,000 polling stations across Australia will open from 8am until 6pm. Because Australia has multiple time zones, here is a breakdown of the times the polling places open: Australia has more than 500 early voting centres, which opened on April 22 and will close on Friday, May 2. About 4.8 million Australians had already cast early ballots as of Thursday. During the early voting period, overseas Australians may vote at overseas voting centres, which include embassies and consulates. While it is not compulsory for overseas Australians to vote, they must notify the AEC if they are not voting. There is also a remote voting system in Australia that opened on April 22. Small AEC teams travel by car, plane, helicopter or boat to collect votes from remote communities. They have visited remote locations and islands, including the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island. Australia also has a postal voting system. A federal election takes place every three years in Australia through a preferential voting system. Voting is compulsory in Australia for citizens aged 18 and older. There are 18 million eligible voters in Australia. Voters must be registered on an electoral roll to be able to cast their ballots. If voters do not vote and fail to submit a legitimate reason, they face a 20-Australian-dollar (US$12.75) penalty. After voters’ identities are verified at polling stations and checked off the electoral roll, they are given two ballot papers – one for each of the two houses of parliament. Voter ID is not required. A green ballot paper is for selecting representatives for the House of Representatives. On this paper, voters must rank all the candidates running in their constituency in order of preference. A white ballot paper is for voters to pick senators. The ballot paper lists parties running in the election at the top of the form while candidates for each party are shown at the bottom. On the white paper, voters choose one of two ways to vote: They can either select a party at the top of the form, or they can rank candidates in order of preference on the bottom part of the form. Pencils are supplied at polling centres, but voters are allowed to mark their votes with pen as well. A candidate wins if they manage to win more than 50 percent of the first-preference votes. If no candidate reaches the 50 percent threshold, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and his or her votes are distributed to the candidate that voters nominated as their second preference. This process continues until a candidate reaches the threshold.  Opinion polls from YouGov suggested Albanese’s Labor Party was leading Dutton’s coalition by a narrow margin in the two-party preferred vote as of Wednesday. The projected vote share for Labor is 31.4 percent and for the Coalition 31.1 percent. If Labor forms a minority government, it is most likely to do so in cooperation with the Greens or with the Teals, a group of centrist independents focused on environmental issues, Charles Edel, senior adviser and Australia chair at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said in a written analysis on the CSIS website. Edel added that the Teals and Greens would likely push Labor’s focus towards environmental issues but are unlikely to influence foreign policy decisions beyond this issue.  The Labor Party won a majority with 77 seats out of 151 in the House of Representatives in the last federal election in 2022. The Liberal-National Coalition won 58 seats. The Greens took four. The election brought Labor back to power after almost a decade. In the Senate, the Labor Party held 25 seats, the Coalition 30, the Greens 11, minor parties six and independents four, when parliament was dissolved on March 28 ahead of the federal elections, leaving a caretaker government in charge.  The key issues shaping the vote include housing costs, the economy, defence and energy. Inflation has caused the cost of living in Australia to surge in recent years. The price of eggs, for instance, rose by 11 percent last year, according to government figures. The Reserve Bank of Australia has increased its benchmark interest rate multiple times during the Albanese administration, hitting a peak in November 2023 at 4.35 percent. In 2023, annual inflation peaked at 7.8 percent. Australia’s high property and rental prices, which have led to unaffordable and scarce housing, are on top of voters’ minds this election. On average, a household in Australia’s largest city, Sydney, needs to earn about 280,000 Australian dollars every year (US$180,000) to be able to afford the median house price of 1.4 million Australian dollars (US$900,000), according to research by the property consultancy PropTrack. The city ranks as the second least affordable out of 94 urban centres globally, according to the International Housing Affordability survey by Demographia, written by the American urban policy analyst Wendell Cox and published in 2024. Average rent in Australia rose by 4.8 percent last year after increasing by 8.1 percent in 2023, according to the property analyst CoreLogic. “This is a crisis that took decades to create, and it’s going to take decades to fix, but we do need someone to step up and take the first steps,” Maiy Azize, the national spokesperson for the pressure group Everybody’s Home, told Al Jazeera. While the Labor Party has promised to build 100,000 homes for first-time buyers, the Liberals have pledged to invest in infrastructure and reduce red tape to speed up housing approvals. Australian politicians face growing calls from voters, especially from younger age groups, to do more to transition to clean energy. A 2023 survey by the independent nonprofit Energy Consumers Australia suggested that about half of Australians aged 18 to 34 want Australia to be powered by renewables by 2030. Both major parties agree that the transition is needed, but the methods to achieve this transition are what divides them. The Coalition seeks the construction of seven nuclear power plants funded by the government, which could begin providing energy by 2035. However, the Labor Party argues that the energy from existing coal- and gas-fired generators would not be enough to meet the country’s needs while Australians wait for nuclear energy to kick off. The party instead proposes to supply 82 percent of Australia’s grid with renewable energy sources.  Ballot counting will begin on Saturday after 6pm Australian Eastern Time (08:00 GMT) once polling stations close. Most postal votes are counted after election day. While the AEC never publishes the final results on the night of the elections – it takes longer than that to count every vote – tallies typically start appearing and may indicate the result much sooner.

Erin Patterson, 50, is on trial for allegedly murdering three people with poisonous mushroom-laced beef wellingtons. An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her former in-laws with poisonous mushroom-laced beef wellingtons refused offers of help serving the dish, the sole survivor of the deadly lunch has told a court. Erin Patterson, 50, is on trial for the alleged murder of her estranged husband’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt, Heather Wilkinson, in a case that has captivated Australia and generated headlines worldwide. Patterson is also charged with the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Heather’s husband and the only surviving guest of the lunch served at Patterson’s home in Victoria on July 29, 2023. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to all charges, with her lawyers arguing that she panicked after unintentionally serving the toxic mushrooms to her relatives in a “terrible accident”. Speaking on day six of the trial, Ian Wilkinson said Patterson had appeared “reluctant” for her guests to go into the pantry. “Both Heather and Gail were offering to help plate up the food,” Wilkinson told the jury at the Latrobe Valley Law Courts in Morwell, about 150km (93 miles) southeast of Melbourne. “The offer was rejected and Erin plated.” Wilkinson said he and his wife experienced vomiting and diarrhoea that night but had dismissed the symptoms as gastroenteritis. The 71-year-old church pastor described Patterson as an acquaintance and said their relationship had been “friendly” and “amicable”, though lacking “depth”. “She just seemed like an ordinary person,” he said. The trial, which is expected to last six weeks, continues.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",-0.9391,0.05,0.843,0.107
